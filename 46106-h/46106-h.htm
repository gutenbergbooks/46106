<h2 class="p4">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p class="pn p2">The outline of the history of the Scottish Parliament,
up to the Union of the Crowns, contained in
the present work, is based upon the Essay on the
Scottish Parliament, to which was adjudged, in 1899,
the Stanhope Prize in the University of Oxford. A
large portion of it has appeared in the <i>English Historical
Review</i> for April and July 1900, and to the
Editors of that periodical thanks are due for their
courteous permission to reprint. Although the main
theme closes with the Union of the Crowns in 1603,
it has been thought desirable to include a brief sketch
of the history of the Estates up to the Union of the
Kingdoms in 1707; but the section dealing with the
seventeenth century makes no attempt to do more than
provide a very brief outline of general tendencies.</p>

<p>The writer wishes to make acknowledgments of
helpful criticism, received in the later stages of the
preparation of this book, from Professor Lodge of
Edinburgh, and from Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, Fellow
and Tutor of New College. To Mr. Fisher, his former
teacher (not of History alone), who continues to the
colleague the same unfailing sympathy and kindness
which he bestowed upon the pupil, the author gladly
takes this opportunity of expressing his especial gratitude,
together with the hope that a debt so pleasant
may be allowed to increase through many years to
come.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="pn p2">The History of Institutions scarcely requires
to-day, the eloquent defence with which the
Bishop of Oxford prefaced his great book, almost
thirty years ago. His own work has proved more
than sufficient defence for his field of labour, and
universal assent would now be given to his claim
that "nothing in the past is dead to the man who
would learn how the present comes to be what it
is." Within the last few years, Professor Maitland
has shown us the importance of much in the
past that was generally regarded as trivial and
incidental. He has illumined, with the torch of
history, the dungeons of learning which have
been generally supposed to form the abode of the
antiquary, and, apart from the brilliant results he
has personally attained, the present generation of
investigators owes to him a clearer conception of
the relation that should exist between more purely
antiquarian pursuits and wider historical studies.</p>

<p>It is true that the institutions which have provided
a theme for Bishop Stubbs and Professor
Maitland, have in part survived from the seventh
century to the twentieth, and that they still form
the basis of the constitutional life of a great
people. For a period of a thousand years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
historical inquirers have been attempting to discover
their origin, and, within the last two centuries,
distinguished thinkers and writers have,
from time to time, attempted to leave to posterity
a worthy record of their history. They have
served as models for continents the very existence
of which was unknown for centuries after English
institutions had assumed a definite shape, and
they have proved capable of a development so
important that they have become the centre of
an empire more than one hundred times the size
of the country in which they originated.</p>

<p>Nothing of this description can be written of
the history of Scottish institutions. They have,
in large measure, disappeared, and it is not
always easy to trace any influence in modern life
which may fairly be attributed to the fact that
they once existed. The constitutional history of
Scotland is partially unrecorded and is, in any
formal way, wholly unwritten. Of the constitution
of the kingdom, as it was when the sixth
James took his seat on the throne of Elizabeth,
only one portion has survived to our own day.
It is a large portion, for it comprises the legal
and judicial system which furnishes so great
a proof of the wisdom of our ancestors, and
which still serves to differentiate a nationality
that inventions and commerce have combined
to destroy. All else has gone. There is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
in Edinburgh "a ghost of speech" which reminds
the curious that men once did more in
the Scottish capital than merely administer the
law; but the "Parliament House" is only a
name&mdash;<i>vox et praeterea nihil</i>. The system of
administration, the methods of finance, the royal
prerogative, the Privy Council, the hereditary
jurisdictions, have vanished. Local jealousies,
clan and family hatreds, the hopes and fears
of noble and burgess and peasant have ceased
to find a place in the national records. The
relations between Church and State, after undergoing
numerous transformations, have been decided
in accordance with the Revolution Settlement,
and have once and again been modified
under Queen Anne and under Queen Victoria.
The General Assembly still meets, but it is not,
and could not be, the General Assembly of John
Knox or of Andrew Melville. The Royal Burghs
maintain their wonted Conventions, but only to
take counsel, and never to act. It is no longer
possible to recognize the fabric of the constitution
of the kingdom which King James left in 1603.</p>

<p>Such a subject as this must, of necessity, occupy
the border between antiquities and history, and it
possesses its full share of the difficulties that beset
the antiquary more than the historian. The
information which it is the antiquary's duty to
collect is widely scattered in bounds of space, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
is possessed of but a meagre connection in
thought. He must be prepared to bring together
his material from many different quarters and to
find it in many varying forms. Facts that have
been preserved because of their local import,
and have been buried in local records far from
the scene of his interest, rumours and legends
that continue to exist in connection with some
individual who finds no place in his main theme,
casual remarks of accidental observers, inferences
deduced from half-forgotten customs and from
dying myths, carefully kept records which,
either wilfully or by chance, are designed to give
a false impression unless read in the light of some
apparently irrelevant circumstance&mdash;such are the
materials on which the antiquary depends. The
writer who is bold enough to undertake an investigation
into the Scottish Constitution will find
the difficulties of the antiquary added to the
troubles of the historian. His task is that
which, of old, Pharaoh set to the children of
Israel&mdash;"Go yourselves, get ye straw where ye
can ... for there shall no straw be given you,
yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks." The
student of the English Constitution can point to
a body of documentary evidence such as no other
nation can produce. What would not the Scottish
student give for the <i>corpus</i> of Anglo-Saxon law,
the magnificent record of Domesday Book, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Dialogue concerning the Exchequer, and the
<i>Modus Tenendi Parliamentum</i>? Yet these constitute
only a small fraction of the material which
now lies ready for the beginner in the study of
English history, and he may learn more in a
month than years of patient labour will yield to
the investigator of the <i>origines</i> of Scottish civilization.
The Scottish Constitution began to take
shape between the reigns of David I and Alexander
III, that is, in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, and the records of these years have
been, in large measure, destroyed. The shock
of the War of Independence arrested its development,
but constitutional movements can again be
traced under David II and James I, and for the
century which connects their reigns (1329-1437)
our information is scattered and meagre. The
English historian knows definitely the racial distribution
with which he has to deal, and he can
disintegrate the influence of Saxon and Dane and
Norman. In Scotland, we have to face at the
very outset, a racial problem as yet unsolved, and
we are called upon to disassociate influences of
the origin of which we are ignorant, and whose
effects we meet only in the mass.</p>

<p>The student who would attempt such a problem
as this must be familiar with the outlines of English
constitutional development, but he must also
be prepared to banish from his mind all prejudices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
and prepossessions derived from such knowledge.
For he will find here no record of liberty slowly
broadening from precedent to precedent, no statesmen
kings, surrounded by sagacious advisers, defining
the scope and the purpose of a legal system,
no patriotic barons, banded together to wrest from
an unwilling monarch a power which was not
being wielded for the national good, no common
aim uniting reformers of the thirteenth century
with reformers of the seventeenth. He can name
here no great names in the progress of constitutional
freedom or in the growth of a consistent
system of law; Scotland produced no Henry the
Second, no Simon de Montfort, no Edward the
First, no Hampden and no Sydney. He must
divest himself of the atmosphere of English
history and be prepared to find a separate people,
affected by influences widely different, and responding
to impulses clearly divergent from the
familiar movements of English history. The
story is not without its heroes, but they are of
a wilder and more romantic type than in England.
James I, throwing himself bravely and
fiercely against the system of abuses which he
found in Scotland, and paying with his life for
his courage and devotion, is a constitutional hero
utterly unlike a Henry or an Edward. This
aspect of Scottish history is the less interesting
and the less definite because it is so largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
impersonal; there are many famous names in
the political and in the ecclesiastical story of
Scotland, but few indeed lend themselves to
brighten the pages that tell of constitutional
development. It is, perhaps, for this reason
that historians have left it alone. Writers on
Scottish history from Boece and Major to Tytler
and Hill Burton have ignored its existence; even
the learned editors of such constitutional documents
as the Privy Council Register and the
Treasurer's Accounts have been pre-occupied by
the varying scenes of the political drama, and
are largely silent on questions relating to the
constitution.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The conditions of government,
justice, and finance before the reign of Malcolm
Canmore, and the relations of the king to his
seven mormaers or earls, are unexplored mysteries.
Not less difficult are the questions that relate to
the next period. How did the burghs come into
being, and whence did they derive that system of
law and custom which was administered by the
Four Burghs and the Hanse Burghs, and which
even Edward I was unable to ignore? How did
the clan-system of the tenth century pass, in the
Lowlands, into the family-system of the twelfth?
Who were the good men who formed the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
of the kingdom, and on whose advice the
kings granted charters and liberties? What was
the real signification of these charters themselves,
and what privileges did they confer? What was
the precise nature of the threat implied in the
warning that a man who neglected the king's
ordinances should lose his court for evermore?
All these are as uncertain as are the powers of
the Executive, the administration of justice, the
police-system outside the towns, or the arrangements
for national defence. Even in the centuries
of our separate history which are most fully
known, the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth,
we are beset by many of the same problems and
by others not less obscure. How far was constitutional
development in Scotland affected by
the short-lived union under Edward I? How far
by the three hundred years of alliance with France?
Can we infer any connection between the German
Diet and the Scottish Estates, between the Lords
of the Articles and the Committee by which
Richard II attempted to supersede the English
Parliament? What is the explanation of the
relative position of the Estates of Scotland, and
of their seemingly capricious periods of importance
under David II and Robert II? Questions
like these, to which no answer has yet been
attempted, await the student of Scottish institutions,
along with the usual problems of finance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
and justice, the Church, the Crown, and the
Legislature.</p>

<p>The present Essay is an attempt to deal, in
outline, with a single aspect of this constitutional
problem. It is the part of the subject on which
most evidence is available, and yet the limits of
evidence are such as to render many of the difficulties
incapable of solution. Almost our only
sources for the earlier period are formal charters
and incidental references by chroniclers. The
scribes who drew up the formal documents were
not concerned with the actual circumstances
which had produced these deeds; it was their
duty to follow the recognized rules of Diplomatic,
rules which had originated in foreign
Chanceries and which bore the impress of a
different civilization. The technical terms in
which they abound are not of Scottish origin,
and are frequently used to describe conditions
to which, in reality, they are totally inapplicable.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
The historians often belong to an era
much later than that of which they write,
and they apply, to questions dealing with
origins, the phraseology of a relatively late stage
of development. When the records of the Acts
of Parliament begin, in the twelfth century,
they yield us only incidental enactments mainly
relating to police methods, and, as they become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
more numerous, they retain their characteristic
of dealing, almost exclusively, with administrative
detail. We possess no writs summoning a Parliament,
no report of a debate in the Scottish
Estates. The constitution of a valid Parliament,
the procedure necessary for prorogation and dissolution,
the rights of the burgess members, were
never definitely decided. The "three Estates"
was a technical term having a different meaning
at different times, and the word Parliament was
applied to bodies so diverse as the great Council
which negotiated the ransom of King David II
and the nobles who entered into a hasty consultation
with James IV at Twiselhaugh. As
English constitutional liberty advanced, phrases
borrowed from the English Commons find a place
in the Scottish records, but they possess no real
significance, and they render more difficult the
task of interpreting the Acts. It is only now
and again that we can speak with certainty of
the membership of Parliament, or of the proportion
of burgesses to barons and ecclesiastics.
The Acts of the Parliament of Scotland give as
little assistance to the historian as it is possible
for such documents to yield.</p>

<p>Our information certainly becomes less meagre
as time goes on. The publications of the Burgh
Records Society are important evidence of the
state of administration in the most favourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
circumstances. The professed histories become
more valuable, and from the beginning of the
sixteenth century there is a large amount of contemporary
description, mainly incidental. Such
references must be collected from the works of
historians like Boece and Major; from the writings
of controversialists like John Knox, George
Buchanan, and James VI; from the diaries of
private gentlemen, preserved to us by an unusually
benignant fate, or from the reports of
ambassadors. We owe more to the intelligent
curiosity of Pedro de Ayala (the emissary of
Ferdinand and Isabella), and of Thomas Randolph
(the agent of Elizabeth), than to many
more serious sources. But contemporary evidence
of this kind must be subjected to rigid
scrutiny. The historian of his own times is
seldom free from the taint of political prejudice,
and the eyes of controversialists are blinded that
they cannot see. The simple diarist is not impressed
by the even tenour of life; his pen
finds an inspiration only in the unusual and the
abnormal, and it is difficult for us to discover
the rules when we are given only the exceptions,
or to keep a true proportion in our mental vision
when we can find no standard of comparison.
Least of all can we give implicit trust to the
political agent, whose motives are uncertain,
and who was himself quite likely to mistake the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
accidental for the normal. Lastly, there are the
formal accounts and the figures, facts, and dates
which appear in official records; but such evidence
is only of subsidiary importance, and, of
itself, can rarely give adequate support to any
theory.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The effect of these limits of evidence will be
obvious on every page of the present work,
and such conclusions as the writer has drawn
must, of necessity, be merely tentative. It is, in
some respects, unfortunate that these conclusions
should be so largely negative in character: that
the general effect is, not so much to show what
the Parliament was, as to point out what it might
have been and was not. One may claim, however,
that even these negative conclusions will
produce ultimately a positive effect, for the reader
must seek out other causes for the results that the
Parliament did not achieve, and other means for
the training that was not supplied by the Estates;
and such an essay as this may serve to warn him
from the wrong track. It may also be useful as
exemplifying the limitations of the doctrine that
national progress can be measured by constitutional
advance. It is impossible to question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
the progress of Scotland between the murder
of the first and the death of the fourth James;
a comparison of the description of Scotland
written by Aeneas Sylvius<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (Pius II), who visited
it about 1438, and the account of the resources
of the kingdom supplied by Pedro de Ayala to
Ferdinand and Isabella,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is a satisfactory object-lesson.
The future Pope writes of a poverty-stricken
land, with miserable inhabitants, dwelling
in wretched houses. The Spaniard found
considerable prosperity and increasing commerce,
with houses "all built of hewn stone, and provided
with doors, glass windows, and chimneys,"
and Italian and French furniture. But between
1437 and 1513 it is not easy to discover any
single token of definite constitutional development,
either in the direction of absolute government
or in that of popular liberty. Not only
does Scotland fail to produce a constitutional
movement like that which characterizes the history
of England; she does not develop any kind
of constitution at all. No absolute monarch, no
oligarchical council, no democratic parliament
occupies the stage of her history for any length
of time, nor does she know any free cities or
any independent duchies. This constant condition
of unstable equilibrium is not precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
analogous to the history of any other European
country, and least of all is it like that of
England, where we are apt to judge of national,
by constitutional, progress. Yet, advance there
certainly was, if not unbroken, still persistent,
and persistently unconnected with questions relating
to the constitution.</p>

<p>The conclusions here stated with regard to
the Scottish Parliament are, however, not entirely
negative. The work of the Estates has
left some positive and definite results of more
than incidental character. The long series of
administrative enactments, dealing mainly with
police methods and with trade, helped the rise
and growth of the Scottish burghs, and, even
outside the burghs, they added something to
the forces that made for peace and good order.
There are occasional measures which found a
lasting influence upon the character of the
people. The Education Act of 1496, which
provided that "all barons and freeholders that
are of substance put their eldest sons and heirs
to the schools, fra they be aught or nine
years of age, to remain at the grammar schools
until they be competently founded and have
perfect Latin, and thereafter to remain at the
schools of art and jure (<i>i.e.</i> the universities), so
that they may have knowledge of the laws,"
forms a fitting conclusion to a century in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the spirit of poetry had deserted England for
her northern neighbour, and in which the successors
of Chaucer are to be found beyond the
Tweed. It was not obeyed in the letter (although
we do find the barons of the sixteenth
century possessed of clerkly skill), but its influence
may be traced in the provision for
education made at the Reformation. Even
when the definite results were less clearly
marked, the existence, in the statute book, of
words and phrases to which a constitutional
meaning might conceivably be attached (like
the existence of parliamentary institutions themselves),
served as a rallying cry for men who
desired reform, and gave to what was really a
new demand the advantage of ancient tradition.
As we proceed, we shall note some instances
of this. The greatest and most lasting effect
of the Scottish Parliament is, however, the
judicial system of the country. Alone among
European countries, Scotland still possesses a
judicature which is the direct descendant of a
Committee of the Estates. The College of
Justice, which, in its present form, was established
in the year 1540, ultimately derives its
powers from the Scottish Parliament, which,
in 1370, first appointed a small committee to
deal with its judicial work. The system of
Scots law, which the Senators of the College<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
of Justice are appointed to administer, is, in so
far as it differs from the law of England, the
product, direct or indirect, of the wisdom of
the Scottish Estates, working on the material
supplied by the civil and the canon law. In
the thirteenth century, the law of Scotland,
which had supplanted the ancient customs of
the Picts and Scots, was largely based on
English law. The Saxon and Norman influences,
which had altered the Scottish Church
and the Scottish language, had introduced into
Scotland many of the leading features of Anglo-Norman
law. "It seems clear enough," says
Professor Maitland,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "that, at the outbreak of
the War of Independence, the law of Scotland,
or of southern Scotland, was closely akin to
English law. That it had been less Romanized
than English law had been is highly probable:
no Bracton had set it in order.... Romanism
must come sooner or later; the later it comes
the stronger it will be, for it will have gone
half-way to meet the mediæval facts." We find,
accordingly, that, later and stronger, the Roman
law did come. After the War of Independence,
Scottish lawyers borrowed little from England,
and, gradually, important differences began to
emerge. Mr. Hill Burton has pointed out that
the statement, frequently made, that the civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
law is part of the law of Scotland, "can only
be true of those portions which have from time
to time been incorporated with it." The selection
of these portions and their local adaptation
formed part of the work of the Judicial Committee
of the Estates. No attempt was made
to codify Scots law for forty years after the
Judicial Committee had been constituted as the
Court of Session, but, in 1574, a commission
was appointed to investigate into the condition
of the law and to report on what they considered
"meet and convenient to be statute."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
source of such additions as those made in accordance
with this enactment was the Roman
law, and the result has been to produce many
discrepancies between Scots and English judicial
institutions. The distinction between law and
equity, for example, so important in England,
is unknown to Scots law, for there never arose
in Scotland a separate series of courts to administer
a common law differing from the Roman
civil law. The fact that the College of Justice
was, in theory, a Committee of the Estates,
has produced some interesting results. The
idea of appeal was unknown in Scotland, or
almost so. The records of the Privy Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
show that the acts of the Court of Session
were sometimes rendered null and void by the
Council,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but the Council in no way exercised
an appellate jurisdiction. In the reign of
Charles II, an attempt was made to create
the Estates into a Court of Appeal from the
College of Justice, and it failed, for the technical
and historical reason that the Parliament had
already delegated its powers to the Senators.
At the Revolution, the Claim of Right demanded
the introduction of some process of appeal,
but the Union negotiations did not deal with
the question, and when, about 1711, in a case
between the Presbytery of Edinburgh and an
episcopal clergyman, the House of Lords heard
an appeal from the Court of Session, they
afforded the first instance of an appellate jurisdiction
in Scottish causes. It is another consequence
of the parliamentary origin of the Courts
of Law that the High Court of Justiciary still
possesses authority "competently to punish (with
the exception of life and limb) every act which
is obviously of a criminal nature, though it be
such which in times past has never been the
subject of prosecution."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The English courts
have no such powers of "declaring" a crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>There are also such familiar technical differences
as those relating to Conveyancing and
the Law of Purchase, and such divergencies
from English custom as the number of a Scottish
jury, and its power to bring in a verdict which
is not unanimous, or the judgment of "Not
Proven," which is unknown to English law.
But beyond all such debatable issues, there are
many important respects in which the law of
Scotland is more considerate of the rights of the
weak than is the law of England. In questions
relating to movable succession, for example,
widows and children are protected from the
eccentricities of death-bed piety; in cases of
legitimacy and marriage the weak can claim
privileges refused to them by English law; and
with regard to divorce, the rights of husband
and wife are equal. The principles of Scots law
which protect the lease-holder and the tenant
against the caprice of the landlord can be traced
to an Act of the Scottish Parliament as far back
as 1449. If the general tendency of the Romanization
of Scots law has been to render it less
harsh, it forms an interesting contrast to the
Romanization of German law, which met with
strenuous opposition, and which increased the
severity of German municipal legislation.</p>

<p>If the production of a legal system forms but
a small <i>apologia</i> for a Parliament which existed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
for several centuries, it nevertheless entitles the
Scottish Estates to be reckoned among the forces
which have made the nation; and it is legitimate
cause of satisfaction that, in spite of all the forces
of misgovernment which held sway for so long,
the peculiarity of the law of Scotland is its regard
for the poor and the weak. If Scottish parliamentary
institutions never produced the complacent
Whiggism of the triumphant middle class
of England, it certainly produced many worse
things, and it is pleasant to find some few that
are better.</p>

<h2 class="p4 b2">THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT<br />

<span class="small">BEFORE</span><br />

<span class="reduct">THE UNION OF THE CROWNS</span></h2>

<p class="pbq">"In Sterling, the king being convoyit to the

young childer are alwayis unconstant and restles,
he preissit to attene to the hole with his finger,

'this parliament hes a hole into it.' Whether
God inspyrit the babe then with prophecie at
that tyme or not, I will not dispute."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p class=" pn p2">The chronicler wrote of the year 1571; but
there are on record few meetings of the Scottish
Parliament at which the "prophecie" might not
with propriety have been made. "This parliament"
throughout nearly all its history "hes a
hole into it." The ruler of Scotland might be
the king; the supreme power might be in the
hands of this or that noble or of this or that
combination of nobles; or it might belong to
the General Assembly of the Church: but rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
indeed was the country governed or guided by
the Estates.</p>

<p>The people of Scotland have ever had a wholesome
horror of works of supererogation. The
Parliament did not meet to rule the country,
but it did meet nevertheless, and those who
summoned it had a definite purpose in view.
What that purpose was may be best understood
if we take, as an illustration, one small section
of Scottish history and note the action of the
parliaments that met during these years. The
reign of Queen Mary nominally lasted from 1542
to 1567; her actual period of rule commenced
with her arrival in Scotland in the summer of
1561, and ended six years later. During these
six years, four parliaments were summoned.
The first of these met in June 1563. While it
transacted some details of business, the main
purpose of its meeting was the forfeiture of the
Earl of Huntly. But the forfeiture of Huntly
was already an accomplished fact, and it gained
nothing in reality from the ghastly scene when
sentence was pronounced upon the half-embalmed
corpse of the rebel lord. A year later Parliament
again met, and annulled the sentence of forfeiture
which had been pronounced, in 1544, upon the
Earl of Lennox. A contemporary inserted in his
diary the innocent remark: "In this parliament,
thair was nathing done, except the reductioun
of the said proces of forfaltoure."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But the Earl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of Lennox had already been some months in
Scotland. In the spring of 1566, a parliament
was summoned which never met. It was called
together to pass sentence of forfeiture upon the
Earl of Murray and his accomplices in the
"Run-about-Raid," and the murder of Rizzio
prevented its assembling. But the insurgent
lords had been exiles for nearly a year. Finally,
in April 1567, Parliament made certain ratifications
of lands&mdash;mainly to nobles against whom
sentences had been passed by the secret council
for their share in the Run-about-Raid and in the
Rizzio murder. But all these lords had returned
and had for some time been in quiet possession
of their estates. The explanation of all these
forfeitures and reductions of forfeitures belongs
to political history. The student of the constitution
will note that the Parliament had no
voice in the matter. The Estates were convoked
because their sanction gave an unquestionable
legality to what had already been done by the
executive power, whatever that might be. Their
function was that of the official who places the
necessary stamp upon an agreement. If the
official were to decline to stamp the paper,
questions about its lawfulness might arise. But
it was just as certain that the three Estates would
sanction the forfeiture of Huntly or the return
of Lennox as it is to-day that an agreement
may be stamped and so made to hold in law.</p>

<p>This is not the view that has appealed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Scottish historians. The late Mr. Hill Burton
maintained a position almost the reverse of the
thesis we have proposed. But, with all deference
to that distinguished scholar, one may be allowed
to argue that he wrote with all the prejudices
of a Whig of the middle of the nineteenth
century. Constitutional progress was, for him,
as for other writers on this subject, the only
justification of a nation's existence. It did not
seem possible that a people could advance
worthily, except as England had advanced. This
predisposition to find in Scotland an analogy to
English parliamentary institutions was encouraged
by the occurrence of many words and phrases in
the rolls of the Scottish Parliament which seem
to the English student quite decisive in favour
of a "constitutional" point of view. But the
history of institutions cannot be written from
their own records. If we possessed, as material
for the constitutional history of Scotland, only
the "Acts" of the Scottish Parliament, our
conclusions would be more radically false than
if there remained to us only the narratives of the
chroniclers and the more strictly political documents.
The "Acts" are written in cipher and
we have to find the key. An important part, for
example, of the records of the revolutions of
1560 and 1640 is to be found in the volumes
which contain the parliamentary proceedings;
but, as we shall have occasion to notice, the
explanation lies elsewhere. It is a further illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of our contention, that so few contemporary
writers were sufficiently impressed by the
Parliament to give any space to the story of its
growth. No man knew the powers of his time
better than did John Knox; and in Knox's
<i>History of the Reformation in Scotland</i> there
are very few references to the Scottish Parliament,
and only one of these is more than incidental. In
this respect, Knox is a fair specimen of early
historians. The only exception is George
Buchanan, who tells of many meetings of "the
Estates, who possess the supreme power in everything."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Buchanan's historical reputation is not
sufficiently high to lend much importance to his
unattested word; and the emphasis which he lays
upon the action of Parliament is so unusual that
it has led to Father Innes's conjecture that he
wrote his "History" in the interests of a republican
theory of government.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Although Innes
had all the prejudices of a Jacobite who lived
before Culloden, his scholarship was undoubted,
and his accusation is striking testimony to the
small place held by Parliament in the pages of
Buchanan's predecessors and contemporaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>An obvious parallel may be drawn between
the Scottish Parliament, as we have described it,
and the English Parliament under the Houses
of York and Tudor. Historians of English
constitutional history have frequently pointed
out that these sovereigns were, by their use of
Parliament, establishing, not their own power,
but that of the institution which they regarded
as a passive instrument in their hands; that
Edward IV and Henry VIII were preparing
difficulties for James I and Charles I. The
force of this argument, as applied to Scotland,
is greatly lessened by the fact that the rulers of
Scotland did not regard as essential the consent
even of a subservient body of Estates. Parliamentary
ratification was, at best, a convenient
method of declaring and recording what had
been done. But it was no obstacle to an act
of the executive that it had not been thus sanctioned.
This want of the continuous and normal
employment of parliamentary procedure combined
with political causes to prevent the appearance of
the effect produced in England.</p>

<p>The view that we have stated can, of course, be
pressed too far. The mere existence of parliamentary
institutions, whatever be their condition
at any given time, is in itself a menace to any
government not founded on the will of the
people. They represent what physicists call
"potential energy." It is, moreover, impossible
for such institutions not to affect, in some way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the life of the people, and to influence the civilization
of the country. There were various times
when the Scottish Parliament gave an earnest of
what power lay underneath its acquiescence.
There were occasions when the rise of a constitutional
opposition was even probable; and
there are places of which we can definitely say
that here or there occurred an event in constitutional
progress. But an investigation in the light
of political history will, we think, go to establish
the general truth of the theory we have adopted.
It might be objected, <i>a priori</i>, that such a theory
does not afford sufficient reason for the continuous
existence of the Estates. But in the
troubled story of mediæval Scotland we find,
readily enough, the explanation at once of the
continuous existence of Parliament and of the
place that it occupied. It was a strictly feudal
society, but it lacked the redeeming features of
feudal government. Feudalism as a system of
land tenure was complete, and it still remains the
basis of Scots law. As a system of government
founded upon land tenure, Scottish feudalism
was, from one point of view, equally efficient,
while, in another aspect, it could scarcely be
said to exist. The Scottish baron was also the
Scottish chief, and to the power of the oath of
allegiance was added the mighty influence of
clan loyalty. But outside this feudal hierarchy
stood the king. Every land-owner in Scotland
held from him, and none regarded him as deserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of more than tolerance. The royal
domains were not large enough to enable the
Crown to cope with the resources of the greater
nobles. The king's best policy was to ally himself
with one faction to destroy another, as James
II overthrew the great house of Douglas. We
cannot speak of any definite coalescence of the
nobles against the king. The jealousy of noble
house to noble house was always greater than
their common dislike of the Crown. So far were
they from being able to unite, that a comparatively
insignificant family like the Crichtons or
the Livingstones were now and again able to
place themselves at the head of affairs.</p>

<p>The frequent occurrence of royal minorities
was at once a cause and a consequence of this
condition of matters. The reigns of the first five
kings of the name of James cover, nominally,
a period of one hundred and thirty-six years.
For fifty-seven years during that time the sovereign
was a minor, and two of the five kings met
their death at the hands of rebellious subjects.
One of them&mdash;James III&mdash;can scarcely be said to
have ruled at all. The weakness of the Crown
is the formula of the explanation of which we
are in search. That weakness was a consequence,
largely, of the action of Edward I of
England. The Bruce was occupied with guarding
against the enemy, and could not offend the
nobles, whose desertion would have been fatal
to the cause of Scotland. The War of Independence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
was the source of the bitter hatred which
separated Scotland from England from the fourteenth
century to the seventeenth, and disputes
with England were directly responsible for the
premature death of the second, the fourth, and
the fifth James, and for the exile of James I&mdash;that
is to say, for four out of the six minorities
between 1406 and 1560.</p>

<p>It is obvious that, in such circumstances, each
of the ever-changing factions who strove for
political importance had an object in availing
themselves of the advantage of parliamentary
and legal sanction. The delegation of work to
committees made it certain that the party in
power could absolutely rely on having its own
way, and the form of law was desirable as legalizing
their present action, and as forming some
kind of defence, should misfortune overtake
them. Similarly the king, when he chanced
to be powerful, found in his parliament a most
useful instrument for carrying out his wishes.
It was, for ruling faction and for powerful king
alike, the best method of registering and declaring
the will or the policy of the rulers of Scotland
for the time being. A parliament, and just this
kind of parliament, was always wanted by the
government.</p>

<p>An alliance between the Crown, the Church,
and the burgesses was, in the circumstances,
out of the question. It was rendered so, in the
first place, by the constant recurrence of minorities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Any such alliance was impossible between
1437 and 1450; between 1460 and 1488; between
1513 and 1530. Moreover, the bishoprics were
often private appanages of noble families,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and
the burgesses were not desirous, so far as we can
judge, of taking any part in political life. At
times, the burgh records are full of instructions
to the commissioners sent to Parliament. These
refer invariably to administrative detail, never to
great political questions. The burgesses were
left to fight for their liberties alone and unaided.
Scotland did not produce, till after the Reformation,
a great middle class of country gentlemen.
The smaller freeholders, influenced by their
strong sense of clan and family loyalty, attached
themselves to the great barons. They were, as
we shall see, never really represented in Parliament
till the reign of James VI, and not till
religious questions assumed a position of importance
did they find any bond of union with the
representatives of the burghs. The growth of
English parliamentary liberty is largely due to
the coalescence of the knights of the shires with
the burgesses, and no such alliance was made in
Scotland before the reign of Queen Mary. It
was in the General Assembly of the Church that
they learned the lesson of combination.</p>

<p>As we have already indicated, the most valuable
work of the Parliament is its record as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
instrument for the peace of the country. It was
a court of justice, and the existing judicature
of Scotland is directly traceable to a committee
of the Estates. It was also the source of
administrative order. Amid all the struggles
of contending factions in the interests of which
the Estates were summoned, there were always
a few&mdash;bishops, or permanent officials, or burgesses&mdash;who
desired to see some acts passed
for the peace of the land. The kings, too, were
never neglectful of this aspect of the work of
Parliament. The great lords had no motive
for opposing; it was always sufficiently easy to
ignore; and, in point of fact, an overwhelming
proportion of the many administrative pronouncements
of the Estates dealt with details
of burghal life, and largely with seaport commerce.
When the Crown was powerful, acts
were passed against the misgovernment of the
great lords; but we know that they were almost
invariably futile, although they offered, at times,
a strong offensive weapon against a noble house
which was, for the moment, in the minority. In
this way they were used alike by king against
noble and by clique against clique. In all that
we have to say of the subservience of the
Estates, this great work of administrative order
must not be forgotten; nor is the student of
municipal history likely to forget it. Parliament,
too, was, if not the originator, the instrument
of taxation, although its importance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
this respect was lessened by the fact that the
hereditary revenues were secured without the
possibility of interference, and it was not till
the close of its history that the Scottish Estates
used the English rallying cry of redress before
supply.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In treating of the subject we propose first to
discuss the origin of the Scottish Parliament,
its membership, and its methods of transacting
business, for on these, in the first place, the
power of any assembly must depend. Afterwards
the question may properly be asked:
What value can we ascribe to the Parliament
as an element in the life of the nation?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="p4">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Origin, Membership, and Method</span></h2>

<p class="pn p2">1. The two most important dividing lines in
Scottish history between the tenth century and
the sixteenth are the reign of David I (1124-1153)
and the War of Independence, which forms a
distinct period not less in constitutional than in
political history. Before the reign of David I,
the Scottish kings had a council of seven mormaers
or earls; but it is difficult to assign to
these any definite status or power, and we are
unable to speak definitely of a General Council
till the mormaers had become feudal barons.
The change is to be attributed to the work of
David I. His Saxon mother, St. Margaret,
had made many changes in her husband's kingdom,
and, by bringing Scotland into line with
other European nations in ecclesiastical matters,
had prepared the way for her son, who was to
place his people under the sway of the great
feudal impulse which was transforming the
nations of Europe. Under David, the new
influences were Norman rather than Saxon.
Norman adventurers, like those who had made
for themselves kingdoms in England, in Italy,
and in the Holy Land, came to the Scottish
court, and received grants of land in the south
and east of Scotland. In this connection, we
find, first of all, names which were to be the
most illustrious in the annals of the country.
To David I the Bruces owed their lands of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Annandale, and the Fitzalans, who were to
become the royal house of Stewart, received
from him their earliest possessions in their
future kingdom. By such grants of land Scotland
was transformed from a tribal into a feudal
country, and there arose a royal council formed
on the normal feudal theory. The "sair sanct
for the crown" completed his work by adding
five to the four already existing bishoprics, and
by founding the great abbeys which were to
gain for him the honour of popular canonization.
Thus bishop and abbot and prior could come
with earl and baron to take counsel for the
weal of the land. Burghs arose and became
prosperous; but two centuries had to elapse ere
the burgesses found a place among the advisers
of the king.</p>

<p>Many of the charters after the time of David I
describe, in somewhat vague terms, those who
gave their consent and attestation; and their
descriptions have been interpreted so as to
afford ground for a theory of popular representation
in the great council which developed
into the Scottish Parliament. Gilbert Stuart
convinced himself that he had proved that Scotland
possessed a full parliament long before the
English burgesses found a place at Westminster.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Even the more cautious Hill Burton considered
that "these curious intimations stand by themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
an acknowledgment&mdash;sincere or not&mdash;of
the admission of popular influence in the actions
of the government."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The claim to have anticipated
the mother of parliaments rests, however,
upon a misconstruction. The phrases on which
it is founded are of three kinds. Some of them
are vague words used by chroniclers, into which
an exact constitutional meaning has been read.
Others are the commonplaces of diplomatic,
used without any appreciation of their strict
signification.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The rest depend upon a misreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of the texts from which they are taken.
The most important term which comes under
the last-mentioned head is one on which Stuart
laid special emphasis. The phrases "all gude
men of the kynrik" and "all the community of
the kynrik" are frequently found in the assizes.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The king statutes "be the counsel of the communite."
But there is an assize of William the
Lion, which is quite definite as to the meaning
of the word. It was made at Perth, on St.
Augustine's Day, 1184, and it bound "byschoppis,
abbotis, erlis, baronis, and thanys, and
all the communyte of the kynrik ... for to
seyk and to get all misdoaris."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The penalty
for disobedience was the loss of a manorial
court. "Gif ony of thaim be attayntit of
brekand this assyse, he sall tyne his court for
evirmar." The whole "community" were lords
of manors. The king, the prelates, and the
barons, great and small, were "the community
of the kingdom."</p>

<p>The burgesses had, indeed, a method of communicating
with the king. Fordun tells us
that in 1211 "King William held a great
council at Stirling, when there were present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
his optimates, who gave him ten thousand marks,
besides six thousand marks promised by the
burgesses." It was with this quotation that
Stuart clinched his argument. But the chronicler's
words do not imply that the grants were
made at the same meeting. We know, too, that
each town sometimes treated separately with the
king; and that for centuries before they were
represented in the Great Councils the burgesses
met in purely burghal assemblies. The "four
burghs" of the South,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of which Edinburgh was
the head, and the "Hanse burghs" of the North,
which grouped themselves round Aberdeen, held
their own conventions, legislated for themselves,
and dealt directly with the king.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> There was no
necessity for their representation in the council.
Beyond statements of chroniclers about the whole
people's choosing a king<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and so forth, we have
absolutely no evidence that the Great Council,
before the War of Independence, was anything
more than a strictly feudal assembly, attended by
such tenants-in-chief as chose to be present.</p>

<p>2. We pass now to consider the membership of
the Scottish Parliament after the War of Independence.
The first instance of the use of the
word "parliamentum" is in connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
treaty of Brigham, made in 1289 between Edward
I of England and the Scots; but the terminology
is obviously due to English influence, and there
is no evidence whatsoever of any popular representation.
It is not till the year 1326 that we
find a complete parliament, containing lords and
commons, and this must be kept in mind while
we proceed to the consideration of the normal
form of the "Estates of Scotland."</p>

<p class="b1">In the first place, we have the clergy. Bishops,
abbots, and priors possessed, as tenants-in-chief,
the same right of attendance in councils as secular
freeholders had, and they could more easily make
use of their opportunities. At the Reformation,
the bishops who became protestants, the lay commendators,
and the "tulchan bishops," seem to
have kept their seats. But acts between 1560
and 1597 speak of the "decay of the ecclesiastical
estate," and we know from the lists of Lords of
the Articles that the clergy almost ceased to be
an essential portion of the Scottish Parliament.
Presbyterianism neither desired nor claimed any
such right. Its aim, as we shall see, was higher.
We do, indeed, find that in 1567 Parliament</p>

<p class="pnbq">thocht expedient ... that thair be adjoynit unto thame in
treating of the thingis concerning the kirkis, thir personis
underwritten, to wit, Maister John Spottiswood, Maister
Johne Craig, Johne Knox, Maister Johne Row, and Maister
David Lindesay or any three or foure of thame.</p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">This, of course, was a special arrangement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
meet a particular contingency. But in 1597
James VI, acting on his principle of "No
bishop, no king," found himself strong enough
to enact that</p>

<p class="pnbq">sik pasturis and ministeris ... as at ony tyme his maiestie
sall pleis to provyid to the office, place, title, and dignitie of
ane bischoip, abbott, or other prelat sall at all tyme heirafter
haif voitt in Parliament.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Next year, the ranks of "sik pasturis and ministeris"
produced three bishops and five abbots,
and thenceforward they increase in numbers,
being reinforced by the Act of 1606 which established
Episcopacy. The Parliament of 1640,
acting on the claim of the General Assembly of
the Church, that "the civill power and place of
kirkmen" was "predjudiciall to hir Liberties, and
incompatible with hir spirituall nature," ordained
"all parliaments to consist of noblemen, barronis,
and burgesses," and of these alone. At the
Restoration, bishops again formed one of the
Estates; but they appear for the last time on the
rolls of Parliament in 1689.</p>

<p>The place of the greater lords in the Scottish
Parliament has long been understood. The
brilliant pen of Professor Innes and the accurate
investigations of Mr. Robertson have, in this
respect, added little to the statement of the case
made by George Wallace more than a century
ago.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The earl or the duke had just the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
right to sit in Parliament as the smaller freeholder.
His title gave him only rank, not power.
It did not even necessarily entail jurisdiction, for
we have instances of earldoms being raised to the
position of regalities.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The king in creating an
earldom did not directly confer the title upon the
new possessor. He created the lands into an
earldom. When the lands were sold the title fell
to the purchaser. Territorial honours could descend
to a female&mdash;although no female might sit
in the king's council&mdash;and could be borne by the
husband of the female possessor. In criminal
trials, lairds were the peers of earls. Had the
Act of 1427 been carried out, it would have led
to an assimilation to the English system of peerage.
The actual change is to be attributed to
the Act of 1587. Really, as we shall see, this act
was a guarantee that the freeholders should have
some influence in Parliament; theoretically, it
involved the abolition of their right to sit in person,
and so converted that right, as it remained
to the greater barons, into the essentials of a
peerage. Personal honours were certainly known
in Scotland before 1587;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> but they were not
peerages in the English sense. The bearers of
these purely personal titles&mdash;the earliest of which
belong to the fifteenth century&mdash;sat in Parliament
in virtue of other claims. But, after the Act of
1587, all honours became personal, and the rules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of descent were altered.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In 1689, the Scottish
nobles obtained a strictly legal recognition of
their rights as possessors of peerages.</p>

<p class="b1">The right of the smaller barons to attend councils
as tenants-in-chief of the king had never
been denied; but there was little to induce them
to take advantage of their opportunities. Travelling
was expensive and dangerous, and unpleasant
incidents were not unlikely to occur in their
absence. Their power in Parliament was small.
Most of them felt that they were sufficiently
represented by the great lord to whose person
and interest they had attached themselves. We
frequently find them appearing by procurators.
When King James I returned from his long imprisonment
in England he adopted the policy of
using the smaller barons against the too powerful
nobles. He had been captured by Henry IV,
and educated amid the influences of Lancastrian
constitutionalism. His aim in Scotland was to
introduce a "new monarchy," and he determined
to make the existence of Parliament the main
weapon in the encounter with his rebellious lords.
Accordingly, in the year 1425, we find that all
prelates, earls, barons, and freeholders, "since
they are holden to give their presence in the
king's parliament and general council," are enjoined
to appear in person "and not by a procuratour,
but if that procuratour allege and prove
lawful cause of his absence." The result perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
surprised the king. There were many "lawful
causes." We have no record of the form they
took; nor do we need any record, for the
political history of the period is clear enough.
All that the rolls of Parliament can tell us is that
the experiment was unsuccessful, for two years
later James adopted a much bolder plan, and
introduced a serious modification of the constitution:</p>

<p class="pnbq">Item, the king, with consent of his whole council general,
has statute and ordained that the small barons and free
tenandry need not to come to parliament nor general councils,
so that of every shiredome there be sent chosen at the head
court of the shiredome, two or more wise men after the
largeness of the shiredome, except the shiredomes of Clackmannan
and Kinross, of the which one be sent of ilk ane of
them, the which shall be called commissioners of the shire.</p>

<p class="pn p1">It was not, of course, the English system of
representation. The English voter had no right
to be present in Parliament. His representative
did more than merely save him the trouble of
attendance. King James did not propose to
extend the franchise as it had been extended in
England. His proposal was much more conservative.
But it was never operative, and, in
a few years, it was completely forgotten. The
smaller barons continued to be regarded as bound
to give attendance in Parliament, and occasionally
some of them were punished for absence.</p>

<p>There is here no indication of the rise of a
constitutional spirit. It was a method of private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
revenge, and measures were passed to relieve the
smaller barons. In 1457 Parliament declared
that "all freeholders under twenty pounds" were
exempted. The limit was raised in 1503 to "a
hundred marks of this extent [<i>i.e.</i> assessment] that
now is." All whose holdings were under that
amount might send procurators, unless they were
specially summoned by the king's own writ. The
procurators were to attend "with the barons of
the shire or the most famous persons." The
phraseology suggests that the "procurators"
might be merely retainers of the greater lords.
All "above the extent of a hundred marks" were
bound to attend "under the pain of the old unlaw."
These acts are generally regarded as
freeing the lesser barons from the burden of
attending Parliament. From all that is known,
alike of the political and of the constitutional condition
of the country, it seems much more likely
that the real burden from which it freed them was
that of "the old unlaw." The distinction is not
without a difference. It was a protection from
the occasional arbitrary employment of a partially
obsolete penalty. The result was the entire
absence of the smaller barons from the meetings
of Parliament. In 1560, when a great question
fell to be decided, and the leaders of the revolutionary
party desired the presence of the freeholders,
the old right was so far doubtful that
a petition was laid before the Estates, in which the
smaller barons claimed&mdash;adopting unwonted language&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
"statutes which they had not been
required and suffered to reason and to vote at
making, should not bind them."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The proceedings
of the parliament of that year were not
confirmed, and our knowledge of them is incomplete.
But we learn from a letter written by
Randolph, the English ambassador, to Cecil, that
among the acts passed on the first day of meeting
was this: "That the Barons, according to ane
old Act of Parliament, made in James's tyme the
first, the year of God 1427, shall have free voice
in Parliament. This Acte passed without aine
contradiction as well of the Bishopes, Papysts,
as all other present."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Randolph has not merely
recorded the fact: he has given us the key to the
situation. It would not have surprised him if the
"Papysts" had objected to the proposal. The
smaller barons were notoriously attached to the
reforming party, and the reassertion of their
right was a precaution taken to secure an overwhelming
preponderance for the new movement.
In 1567, Parliament was again divided. There
was a "queen's party" and a "king's party." It
is not improbable that the experience of 1560 led
the insurgent lords to enact that, because "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
barons of this realm ought to have vote in Parliament
as a part of the nobility," each sheriff was
to be instructed to summon the barons of his
shire "by open proclamation at the market cross
of the head burgh of the same, to compear within
the Tolbooth upon eight days' warning ... and
there to choose one or two of the most qualified
barons ... to be commissioners for the whole
shire." Once again legislation was fruitless, and
the fact confirms the suggestion that it was a
mere party move. But it called attention to a
constitutional grievance, and twenty years later
the matter was taken up in earnest. It is not
easy to believe that action was taken in 1585
purely out of love for constitutional principles.
A keen religious contest was in progress, and the
smaller barons were, as in 1560 and 1567, on the
side of the General Assembly. One is therefore
inclined to infer that the "article" which was
presented to Parliament urging how "necessary
it is that his highness and they be well and truly
informed of the needs and causes pertaining to
his loving subjects in all Estates, especially the
commons of the Realm," originated in ecclesiastical
quarters. It was decided to reaffirm
the "gude and lovable" Act of 1427. The details
of machinery need not detain us. There
was to be an election of "two wise men being
the king's freeholders resident indwellers of the
shire of good rent," chosen by "all freeholders
of the king under the degree of prelates and lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of Parliament," who have "forty shillings land
in free tenandry of the king and their actual
dwelling and residence within the same shire."
The act was ratified two years later, when his
Majesty had reached "his lawful and perfect
age of twenty-one years complete"; and it was
added that the shires should be taxed to pay
the expenses of their commissioners. No other
alteration of principle took place until the
Reform Act of 1832. In the reign of William
and Mary the proportion of members to each
shire was readjusted. But the Acts of 1585
and 1587, succeeding where the Act of 1427
had failed, detached the small barons from the
greater freeholders and created a new "Estate"
of the realm.</p>

<p>3. We have seen that down to the War of
Independence there is no ground for believing
that burgesses attended the great council of the
kings. When the first Scottish "Parliament"
met after the battle of Bannockburn, there was
no indication that anything had happened in the
interval to change its constitution. In 1314, and
again in 1315, in 1318 and in 1320, we read of
"full parliaments," the members of which are
described in the old terms. At none of these
meetings, so far as we know, was any momentary
business transacted. But in 1326 King Robert
summoned to meet him, at the Abbey of Cambuskenneth,
associated with the victory of Wallace,
and almost within sight of the field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Bannockburn, a parliament which was to settle
the pecuniary relationships of king and people,
and reimburse the king for the expenses of the
war. To this parliament King Robert called
not only noblemen, but "burgesses and all other
free tenants of the kingdom." To the agreement
then made, the seals of the burghs were appended.
To what circumstances are we to attribute this
development? It is, of course, natural that the
royal burghs should come to be represented in a
council of tenants-in-chief, as the "barons of
London" and the imperial cities found their way
into the Parliament of England and the Diet of
the Empire. But the institutions of the Courts
of the Four Burghs and of the Hanse Burghs
offered an alternative line along which the development
of burghal representation might have
gone; and, in point of fact, the Convention of
Royal Burghs did continue to possess and to
exercise certain powers which appear to us proper
to Parliament. The meeting at Cambuskenneth
in 1326 is thus, to some extent, a critical point,
and its importance is increased by the king's
attempts to render burghs dependent on great
nobles instead of upon the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> These
attempts were rendered illegal by Parliament in
the reign of David II; but plainly, if they had
not possessed, at this juncture, a voice in Parliament,
the history of the burghs might have been
widely different.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>We may hazard a guess why King Robert
did not negotiate with the burghs in the accustomed
way. In 1305, when the chances of the
independence of Scotland seemed very small,
Edward held a parliament in London, which
was attended by Scots representatives&mdash;by whom
elected or chosen, we do not know. Robert
the Bruce was also present, as an English lord.
Possibly he found his model in the burgesses
who thronged the English Parliament. It must
also be recollected that, since the end of the war,
King Robert had entered into a new relation
with a burgh. Hitherto the Scottish kings had
spoken of the burgesses rather than of the burgh.
But, in 1319, Robert I gave a charter to the
city of Aberdeen, in which he recognized it as
a corporation, and granted it certain possessions,
on condition of an annual payment, assessed by
the burgh itself.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Edinburgh received a similar
charter in 1329.</p>

<p>It is generally assumed that the presence of
burgesses at Cambuskenneth in 1326 was an
admission of their right to a share in the work of
Parliament. "From henceforth," says Professor
Innes, "undoubtedly, the representatives of the
burghs formed the Third Estate, and an essential
part of all parliaments and general councils."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
The records, as we possess them, do not bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
this out. It is true that the "parliaments" of
Edward Balliol refer to the "assent des Prelatz
Countes Barouns Chivalers et toux autres assemblez":<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
but this is merely a return to the older
nomenclature. In 1339, Robert the Steward of
Scotland speaks of the prelates and magnates
of the kingdom alone as constituting a "full
parliament." Two years later, a "full parliament"
was held at Aberdeen, and although part
of its business was to grant a charter to the
burgh, only bishops, lords, and freeholders
("milites") were present. Similarly, in 1358
and 1359, we have no record of the presence of
burgesses. The Parliament of 1363 speaks of
the "three estates," but we know that there were
present only the "prelati et proceres" of the
realm.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But in 1356-57, and again in 1363,
councils were held at which burgesses were
present. On both these occasions the subject
under discussion was the raising of money. It
is probable that the constitutional theory at this
date was that the burghs were to be consulted
only on pecuniary matters. In confirmation of
this view, we may point to the wording of the
record of the Council of 1363. It tells us that
the lords were present as usual, and that there
were also summoned others "who are wont to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
be called to a council of this kind," <i>i.e.</i> a money
council. Three years later, money was again
needed. A convention was held at Holyrood
in May 1366, to consider the terms of peace
with England, which involved considerable pecuniary
adjustment. The nobles decided to call a
parliament and to summon the common people
"who will not be present and will not promise
to be present."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Bishops, abbots, and lords
were called "in the accustomed manner," and
there attended "from every burgh certain burgesses,
who were cited for this purpose." They
were represented in 1367, in June 1368, possibly
in March 1368-69, and certainly in February
1369-70 and March 1371-72. It is possible
that from the end of the fourteenth century the
burgesses took their place in every parliament;
but there are many instances between 1372 and
1455 in which we cannot trace their presence.
From 1455 onwards they are found in every
parliament and on the regular committees.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>It remains, in this connection, to determine
how far the burgess members were elective or
representative in the strict sense of the word.
In the early references to the presence of burgesses
in Parliament, we have no hint of any idea
of a definite representation constituted by a form
of election. To the Cambuskenneth Parliament
of 1326 the burgesses seem to have come as other
free tenants came. There attended "burgesses
and all other free tenants of the kingdom." We
know nothing of the conditions of attendance of
the burgesses in 1356-57; and in 1366, as we
have seen, "certain burgesses" were present,
who had been specially summoned. In neither
case, nor anywhere else, do we find any suggestion
that the burghs chose representatives. We
are brought, therefore, to the year 1367. In that
year, when the Estates met, it was found that
so many burgesses attended that their presence
would interfere with harvesting operations, and,
accordingly, "certain persons were elected to
hold parliament, and permission was given to
the rest to go home, because of the harvest."
This, then, is the first record of the election of
a committee to do the work of Parliament. The
wording of the record is important. "On the
part of the burgesses there were elected: from
Edinburgh, Adam de Bronhill and Andro Bec;
from Aberdeen, William of Leth and Johne
Crab; from Perth, Johne Gill and Johne of
Petscoty; from Dundee, William of Harden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
William of Inverpeffer," and so forth. Burgesses
were present in considerable numbers&mdash;at all
events, in such numbers that two members could
be chosen (<i>electi</i>) to represent each town. Similarly,
in the next instance (1369), "it did not
seem fitting that the whole community should
be kept in attendance," and two committees
were appointed, one for the general work of
legislation, and the other to conduct the judicial
business which belonged to the Estates. It
seems not improbable that we have here a system
according to which any burgess that chose might
attend. If so, these elections to committees were
really the earliest efforts at parliamentary representation
in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> In short, the evidence,
positive and negative, warrants, perhaps, the
conjecture that, at the first, the burghs chose
no representatives, but that such burgesses as
cared to attend were the representatives of the
burgh; that the appointment of committees
formed really the germ of the elective idea, by
necessitating a choice after Parliament met; and
that, in course of time, it became apparent that
the election might as well be made at home as
in Edinburgh or at Scone.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The earliest records<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of parliamentary elections that we possess are
statements, in burgh accounts, of payments made
to commissioners to the Estates. It is significant
that they date from the beginning of the fifteenth
century, by which time the device of appointing
committees had been frequently employed.</p>

<p>There are two other points in the membership
of the Scottish Parliament which must deserve
mention. The great officers of state<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> possessed
<i>ex officio</i> seats in Parliament. It was an arrangement
which had much to commend it; but there
was a tendency for it to become burdensome;
and in 1617 an act was passed prohibiting more
than eight officers of state from possessing official
seats in Parliament. It was customary also, from
an early period, for the eldest sons of the great
nobles to be present at meetings of the Estates.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
They were in no sense members of Parliament.
They had no right either of speaking or of
voting. But had circumstances been more
favourable to the growth of the power of
Parliament, the conception of such a training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
for legislative responsibility might have been
rich in practical results.</p>

<p>The composition of the Scottish Estates offers
a tempting parallel to that of the German Diet
after the Great Interregnum. Constitutional
development ran in the two countries on somewhat
similar lines: the position of the king of
Scotland was often analogous to the place held
by the emperor; nobles and prelates correspond
to the temporal and ecclesiastical princes, and
the royal burghs to the free cities, while in
neither assembly were there any members like
the English "knights of the shire." But there
does not seem to be any ground for regarding
the likeness as more than a coincidence, or for
disputing the "orthodox" theory which declines
to admit the existence of German influence over
Scotland before the sixteenth century. Had we
any definite constitutional life to record, it would
be of interest to discover in what relation the
three Estates stood to each other. But as to
this we have almost no evidence. The first
instance of the occurrence of the term the
"three Estates" (<i>tres communitates</i>) in the acts
belongs to the year 1357.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> In mediæval times,
the three Estates are the clergy, barons, and
burgesses. When James I attempted to introduce
commissioners from shires into Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he really contemplated the creation of an additional
Estate, and after his scheme was actually
carried out by James VI<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> there were three or
four Estates according as the clergy were represented
or not.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The word "Estates" is not
specially appropriate, and the Estates of the
realm of Scotland must not be confused with
the English use of the word.</p>

<p>It has been surmised that the clergy and the
burgesses acted with the Crown, in opposition
to the nobles; but to state such a formula is
to read English ideas into Scottish history.
The historian can point to scarcely an instance
where the nobles were definitely ranged in a
body against the king. If nobles were the most
prominent opponents of the Crown, nobles were
also its most prominent supporters, although the
<i>personnel</i> of both parties constantly varied. The
bishops, as we have seen, were often dependent
upon the great lords. As to the burgesses, it
seems to be clear that the three or four of them
who were included among the Lords of the
Articles acted with the party in power. Only
thus can we explain the fact that alike when
the Douglases and the Boyds and the Hamiltons
ruled the land the administrative enactments of
Parliament progressed without any difficulty.
These acts were frequently passed "by request
of the burgesses," and they were obeyed only
in the towns. The people of the towns had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
small reason to oppose either noble or king.
The hand of the great lord lay heavy on the
inhabitants of the country, but the burghs knew
no such pressure.</p>

<p>4. Scarcely less important than the membership
of a parliamentary body is the method of
its deliberation. In this respect the Scottish
Parliament was widely different from that which
sat at Westminster. The three Estates met in one
chamber. In the centre was the seat occupied
by the sovereign, when he was present in person;
in later times, by his commissioner. On the
left hand sat the noblemen and barons; on the
right, the prelates and the representatives of
burghs. The Estates voted together. The
president was, in general, the lord chancellor.
He was, at the first, nominated by the king for
the purpose, but he gradually came to hold the
position <i>ex officio</i>. The absence of a speaker
for the Commons deprived them of much of
the power possessed by the third Estate in
England. The Act of 1427, to which we have
already referred, included among its provisions
the creation of this office; but, like the rest of
the act, this clause was not enforced, and it was
never resuscitated. The theory of the three
Estates was practically complete by the year
1400, although we have occasional instances of
legislation without this formality. A parliament
of James II, for example, made a statute regarding
merchants "with consent of the clergy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
barons alone," and in 1449, on a question of
heirship, the prelates and burgesses were "removed"
before the decision was made.</p>

<p class="b1">The relations of the Estates to the Crown
were in an unsatisfactory condition. In times
of stress the Parliament had no hesitation in
appointing its own president. Randolph, in
his letter to Cecil,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> mentions that, in 1560,
Lethington was "chosen harangue-maker." In
1640, again, Robert, Lord Burley, was elected
"president of this court and session of Parliament,
in the absence of the king's commissioner."
In strict legal theory both of these meetings were
probably invalid. It is difficult to understand
how far the royal assent was necessary to the
validity of acts. In ordinary circumstances, a
necessary condition of a valid parliament was
the presence of the regalia, and the king gave
his approval by touching the bills or "articles"
with the sceptre, whereupon they became acts
of parliament. The want of constitutional life
prevented the question from arising in a definitely
constitutional manner. When the difficulty
did appear, it was, like the similar problem of
the presidency, settled without any debate; and
we have no instance except in times of revolution.
There is an interesting passage in Knox's
<i>History</i><a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> in which he discusses the matter in
connection with the great Parliament of 1560,
which established the Protestant faith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
which did not receive the royal consent till it
was ratified in 1567, when the Earl of Murray
had assumed the regency for the infant whom
he had made James VI. The historian tells us
that Francis and Mary withheld their consent.
"But that we litill regarded or yit do regarde;
for all that we did was rather to schaw our
debtfull obedience, than to beg of thame any
strength to our Religion." The point is thus
contemptuously dismissed, but Knox considered
it necessary to give more attention to a possible
objection that the Parliament was not legally
summoned in the first instance. "But somewhat
most we answer to suche as since hes
whispered, that it was bot a pretended parliament."
He solved the matter by a legal
quibble, and proceeded to affirm, in addition,
that it was the only free parliament which had
been held: "In it, the votes of men were free
and gevin of conscience; in otheris thai war
bought or gevin at the devotioun of the prince."
Such sentiments as these can scarcely be said
to represent any advance in constitutionalism.
We may place alongside of them the views of
King James VI, as he expressed them to his
English Parliament in 1607.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p class="pbq">For here I must note unto you the difference of the Parliaments
in these two kingdomes, for there they must not speak
without the Chancellor's leave, and if any man doe propound
or utter any seditious or uncomely speeches, he is straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
interrupted and silenced by the Chancellor's authoritie....
About a twentie dayes or such a time before the Parliament,
Proclamation is made throughout the kingdom, to deliver
into the King's Clearke of Register all Bills to be exhibited
that Session before a certain day. Then are they brought
unto the king, and perused and considered by him, and only
such as I allowe of are put into the Chancellor's hand to be
propounded to the Parliament. Besides, when they have
passed them for lawes, they are presented unto me,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and I
with my Scepter put into my hand, by the Chancellor, must
say: "I ratifie and approve all things done in this present
Parliament." And if there bee anything that I dislike, they
rase it out before. If this may bee called a negative voyce,
then I have one, I am sure, in this Parliament.</p>

<p class="p1">The contradictions find, as usual, their reconciliation
in fact: King James described the
forms normally used; Knox regarded them as
not in any degree essential to the validity of
Parliament. The rules of procedure certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
tended to a despotic monarchism. But they
owed their existence simply to custom, and
could not be regarded with any peculiar reverence,
when the popular party was uppermost.
There had never been any definite settlement.
They governed who had the power; they kept
the forms who could.</p>

<p>5. The most characteristic portion of the procedure
of the Scottish Parliament was the devolution
of the work of legislation upon committees.
The origin of the committee which
became famous under the title of the Lords of
the Articles is one of the standing puzzles of
Scottish history. The date of its first appearance
is well known, but how or wherefore
parliamentary procedure took this peculiar form
has been a standing problem.</p>

<p>The first instance of the appointment of a
committee (1367) has been already quoted.
The record for that year mentions that certain
persons were elected by the Estates to hold the
Parliament, and leave was given to the rest to
go home, on account of the harvest.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> As we
have seen, burgesses found a place on the committee.
The next Parliament met in June, 1368,
and it contained burgesses among its members,
but there is no mention of a committee. In
March 1368-69, certain persons were again elected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to hold Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and the reason for allowing
the rest to go home is stated to be the political
and economic difficulties of the time. On this
occasion burgesses do not appear on the list of
the committee, and we have no definite assurance
of their presence. In February 1369-70 we know
that burgesses were present,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and we are told that
when Parliament met it did not seem expedient
that the whole "communitas" should take part
in the business ("universalis communitas ad
deliberationem huiusmodi intenderet seu eciam
expectaret"), and two committees were appointed&mdash;one
to deal with general business and the other
with matters connected with the administration of
justice.</p>

<p>At this point it may be well to state the kind
of business transacted at these various parliaments.
In 1367 financial matters formed the
most important portion of the business of Parliament,
and we are therefore prepared to find
burgesses on the committee. In March 1368-69,
when we have no assurance that burgesses were
present, the most important item of business was
the pacification of the Highlands; but an enactment
was made which was of special interest to
the burghs, for Lanark and Linlithgow were
given places in the Court of the Four Burghs,
instead of Berwick and Roxburgh, now held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
"our adversaries the English." In 1369, when
burgesses were elected to the Committee for
Justice, that committee had to deal with a
dispute between the town of St. Andrews and
the guild of Cupar, while the committee for
general business, on which they do not appear,
dealt with the question of the king's debts,
taxation, police, and the war with England.
There is little in all this to give us any guidance
as to the origin of committees. The facts, so
far, seem equally compatible with the unwillingness
of burgesses to attend, of which the nobles
had complained in 1366, and with an attempt
on the part of the nobles to reduce the burgess
element and to monopolize the efficient power
of Parliament.</p>

<p>The subsequent history of these committees
proves that, whatever was their origin, they did
become an instrument in the hands of cliques
of nobles. The next instance is in March
1371-72, when the precedent of 1369 was deliberately
followed,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and two committees were
again elected&mdash;one for justice, and the other to
treat and deliberate upon special business as a
preliminary to its being brought before the great
council.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It is simply stated that leave was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to the rest to go away. There are no lists of
members of either committee, nor is there any
record that the "special business" was ever submitted
to a parliament. The statutes promulgated
by the committee bear that they have been
made by the consent of the three Estates, or by
persons elected in the same parliament to transact
business.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> An oath to observe the statutes was
taken after they were passed, and it is remarkable
that only the barons are mentioned as taking it.
This is suggestive of the absence of burgesses
from the General Committee, in accordance with
the precedent of 1369, and the very first clause<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
in the recital of the actions of the General Committee
gives some indication that it was desired
to exclude certain persons from it. It was ordained
that no one who had been elected a
member of the committee should bring to its
meetings anyone not so elected, except a member
of the Privy Council. The business included an
act which is summarized by an assertion that
the commands of the king are not to be obeyed
in preference to the law of the land ("Mandata
Regis non exequenda contra statuta vel formam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
iuris"). The weakness of Robert II, already an
old man, and the general political history of the
time, render it impossible to accept this as a
constitutional claim, and the overwhelming probability
is that Parliament was, as so often
afterwards, in the hands of a small clique of
nobles, who used it for their own purposes.
Possibly, the barons who were really responsible
for the misgovernment of the country, wished
to avoid meeting, in the committee, anyone
who might be bold enough to draw attention
to the real facts of the case. At all events
there must have been some reason for following
the precedent of 1369 instead of that of 1367,
and thus excluding the burgess element.</p>

<p>Between the year 1371 and the return of James
I from exile we have no information regarding
Parliament. There are references to the three
Estates in 1384, and again in 1398; but we are
without any hint of the method of conducting business,
and almost the only records that have come
down to us are charters. In 1424 the old phraseology
reappears: Certain persons were elected to
decide upon the articles submitted by the king
("Electi fuerunt certi personae ad articulos datos
per dominum regem determinandos"). This is the
first recorded instance of the term "Articles,"
by which the committee was to be known. In
March 1425-26, there is no record of any such
committee. In March 1425-26, in May 1426,
and in September 1426, we find committees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which are said to be elected by the whole counsel
of the three Estates. In July 1427, in March
1427-28, in July 1428, in April 1429, in March
1429-30, and in April 1432, we have again no
record of their existence. At a parliament held
at Perth in October 1431, a committee was
appointed for special police and judicial purposes,
and it met in May 1432 and passed
certain acts. In March 1433, we read of no
committee; in October 1434, only of a committee
for justice, which included burgess members; and
in 1436, of no committee. From the second year
of the active reign of James I to his death we
have, then, no trace of the General Committee
of the Articles.</p>

<p>Between the murder of James I, in February
1436-37, and the fall of the house of Douglas, in
February 1451-52, there are records of several
meetings of Parliament, but there is rarely any
evidence of the presence of burgesses at all.
In connection with the coronation of James II,
there is a formal document, of uncertain date,
which revokes grants of land made by James I
without consent of the three Estates, and commissioners
of burghs are mentioned as being
present at this "general council." The revocation
is of political importance, and has no
real constitutional significance. When Parliament
met, in March 1437-38, the three Estates
are mentioned, but only nobles and barons and
freeholders went to Holyrood to crown the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
king.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> These are just the formal occasions on
which it was desirable to have the unquestionable
legal authority of the "three Estates," and burgesses
may have been really there, though it is
strange that they were not present at the ceremony
in the Abbey. There is no trace of their presence
till 1449, and, in their absence (if absent they
were), we find no hint of the existence of committees.
They were present at the Parliament
which met in January 1449-50,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> when the young
James II first asserted himself by procuring the
forfeiture of the Livingstones. It is equally
significant that committees were not elected on
this occasion; it is becoming evident that the
device of the Articles was employed, not in every
case when burgesses were present, but only when
their aid was not desired by the predominant
party in Parliament. During the final struggle
with Douglas there is again no reference to burgesses,
but in August 1452, when the king had
defeated the great house, we find burgesses represented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in Parliament, and there is again no
mention of the Articles. In August 1455 the
dress of burgess members is regulated by statute,
and their attendance is regarded as normal.
During the personal rule of James II, which
continued till his death in 1460, burgesses are
constantly represented, and the only committees
of which we read are for justice alone, to which
burgess members were elected.</p>

<p>During the first few years of the minority of
James III the policy of the late king was continued
under the strong hand of Bishop Kennedy,
and it is not till after his death, in 1465, that the
Lords of the Articles reappear. In 1467, Lords
of the Articles were appointed, and thenceforth
their power and importance greatly increased.
In 1469, they were empowered to report, not to
the whole Parliament, but to a committee constituted
on the analogy of the Lords of the
Articles themselves, "with power committed by
the whol Estates ... to advise, commune, and
conclude." Two years later the membership of
this plenipotentiary committee became almost
identical with that of the Lords of the Articles,
who thus, practically, received power to report
to themselves and to ratify their own conclusions
"upon all matters concerning the welfare of our
Sovereign lord ... and the common good of
the realm." "Our Sovereign lord" was, at the
time, a captive in the hands, at first of the
Boyds, and afterwards of the Hamiltons, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the rapid development of the powers of the
Lords of the Articles is explained by the desire
to exclude any adherents of the opposite faction
from voice or vote in Parliament, and, as such,
it continued to be employed.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>On a general review of the evidence several
points are clear. The device of superseding
Parliament by a committee was employed for
the first time under a weak king, and precisely
at the moment when burgesses were first appearing
as an integral part of Parliament.
After it was elaborated in 1369, the method
continued to be employed on every occasion
on which burgesses were present, and, so far
as we know, only when burgesses were present,
till the return of James I from England; and
its usual result was to exclude the burgess element
from the effective work of Parliament.
From the date when James I had established
his power to the time of his murder, in 1436-37,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
burgesses were regularly present, and there were
no committees, except for judicial purposes, and
on these burgesses were represented. The ordinary
business of Parliament was transacted
by the three Estates meeting in their full
numbers. Between the death of James I and
the fall of the house of Douglas, in 1451-52,
we are again uncertain as to the presence of
burgesses in Parliament, and there were no
Lords of the Articles, so far as can be ascertained.
The one occasion on which we know
that burgesses took a share in the work of
Parliament was in January 1449-50, when the
young James II first asserted himself by procuring
the forfeiture of the Livingstones, and
here, as under the strong rule of James I, the
presence of burgesses is no longer accompanied
by the existence of the committees which occupy
so prominent a place when burgesses are present
and the barons are in power. So, again, after
the king had defeated the great House, and had
begun to rule in person, we find burgesses regularly
present in Parliament, and the only committee
was the judicial one, on which they find
a place. During the first few years of the
minority of James III the policy of the late
king was continued by Bishop Kennedy, and
it is not till after his death that the Lords of
the Articles reappear. During the years of
intrigue and faction which followed the death
of Kennedy in 1465, the Committee of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Articles was developed and established as a
normal part of parliamentary procedure.</p>

<p>The invariable correspondence between the
presence of burgesses in Parliament and the
use or disuse of the system of committees,
according as the king was weak or powerful,
suggests as a possible explanation that the
origin of the Committee of the Articles may
be traced to an attempt of the barons to exclude
the burgesses from Parliament. This
view is confirmed to some extent by the fact
that in 1371-72, within two years of the first
employment of the device, the committee for
the general business of Parliament seems to
have been used for the purpose of excluding
certain persons, while, both in 1369 and in
1371-72, burgesses were present in Parliament
and were not elected to the General Committee.
It was, further, only in this indirect way that
Parliament could control the number of burgess
members, for there is no evidence of the passing
of any act dealing with burgess representation,
and, as late as 1619, the Convention of Royal
Burghs<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> ordered that every burgh, except Edinburgh,
should send only one, instead of two,
members to Parliament, and the resolution was
carried into effect without even the formality of
consulting the Estates. It cannot, however, be
said that the evidence excludes the alternative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
explanation that these committees originated
simply in the unwillingness of the burgesses to
attend Parliament, and were afterwards employed
by the barons for purposes of faction. But it
is difficult to reconcile this view with the fact of
the appearance of burgesses, in 1367, in such
numbers that a choice of two members from
each town could be made from among them,
and with the instances of their retention for
judicial purposes only, as well as with the concomitance,
just pointed out, of the presence of
burgesses and the election of Lords of the
Articles.</p>

<p class="b1">The next development in the history of the
General Committee belongs to the year 1535,
when King James V dispensed with the cumbrous
device of two committees, and the Lords
of the Articles entirely superseded the three
Estates. As the Crown chanced to be strong,
the committee was not allowed to deal with "all
matters" as in the days when the king was weak,
but only with such matters as it might "please
his grace to lay before them," and King James
reserved to himself the power of summoning all
his prelates and barons if he should so wish.
The new scheme was only for occasional use,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
but it familiarized people with the all-sufficiency
of the Lords of the Articles, and during the
next reign Parliament ratified, without comment
and as a matter of form, what they had done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Randolph, the English ambassador, has preserved
for us a record of the proceedings in
1563.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">During the early part of the reign of Charles I,
and between the Restoration and the Revolution
of 1689, this was the normal procedure. The
Parliament met in full only on the first and the
last days of its meeting. It was of small value
that every liege had free access to the Lords of
the Articles, to lay his complaints before them,
but even that privilege seems to have been
occasionally doubtful.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The importance of the Lords of the Articles
clearly depended upon the method of their election.
It has been supposed that, at first, each
Estate elected its own representatives. But the
non-appearance of burgesses on the General Committee
in 1369 is, perhaps, an indication to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
contrary. In 1524, the spiritual lords were
chosen by the temporal lords. We know this
only from certain protests which were made, and
it is not easy to draw any inference from it.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Randolph,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> to whom we owe so much of our
information regarding Scottish affairs in the latter
half of the sixteenth century, described to Cecil
the method in vogue in 1560. His words imply
that it was the ordinary custom. "The lords
proceeded immediately hereupon to the chusing
of the Lords of the Articles. The order is that
the lords spiritual chuse the temporal, and the
temporal the spiritual, and the burgesses their
own." From 1592 to 1609 the selection is said
to be made by "the whole Estates"&mdash;whether
collectively or independently is not stated. In
1606, 1607, and 1609, King James nominated the
members who were elected, and in 1612 he devised
a very characteristic arrangement which, in
part, reverted to the method described by Randolph.
There were at this date very few prelates,
and they were all his own creatures.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The lords
temporal, therefore, could not but choose lords
spiritual agreeable to the king, and they, in turn,
could select from the nobles men as obsequious
as themselves. The representatives of the prelates
and nobles must select suitable men from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Third Estate. Such was the royal scheme. We
hear of it first in 1612.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> We are fortunate enough
to possess an account of the "Ordour and Progres
of the Parlement, October 1612," from a
manuscript in the handwriting of Sir Thomas
Hamilton, the secretary.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> When the Estates
had met, and had listened to a sermon by the
archbishop of Glasgow and a speech from the
king's commissioner, the prelates and noblemen
were instructed to retire, to choose the Lords of
the Articles. The secretary intimated privately
to the lords temporal the names of the prelates
whom the king wished to be chosen. They
"debaited the mater verie preciselie," having
first dismissed the secretary, "and after many
discourses of the necessitie of the mentenance of
thair privilegis and libertie, be pluralitie of votes,
changed so many of the roll of the prelates as
they had men to make chainge of." The bishops,
on the other hand, received "the roll of the
noblemen whom his Maiestie recommended to be
upon the Articles, whilk thay presentlie obeyed be
thair electioun." When the prelates and noblemen
met to choose the commissioners of barons
and burgesses, both maintained their attitude,
"and maid sum chainge, so far as the noblemen
could." This method did not become fixed till
1633, but it represents more or less accurately
the condition of matters between 1612 and 1638.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The usurpation of all parliamentary power
was, of course, bitterly resented. As early as
1524 we have evidence of opposition; but the
dispute of that year was rather personal than
political, and not in any sense constitutional.
The first constitutional protest dates from the
year 1633.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> But even this is rather a remonstrance
against the decisions of the Lords of the
Articles than against their election and procedure,
although there are references to these. Burton
guardedly describes the incident as containing
"distinct vestiges of a constitutional parliamentary
opposition."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In 1640, Parliament, no
longer under royal control, ordained that the
Lords of the Articles should be "ane equall
number of all Estates, and ... chosen by the
haill bodie of the Estates promiscououslie and
togidder, and not separatlie, by ilk ane of the
thrie Estatis apairt." In 1663, by command of
the king the older method was restored, and it
continued in force till the Revolution. The
parliament of 1690 abolished the Lords of the
Articles, and declared that "the estates may
appoint such Committees as they choose, there
being an equal number of each estate." Such is
the history of that important body.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of the Judicial Committee has been
often told, and need not detain us long. We
have already seen the first appointment of a
commission to undertake the judicial work of
Parliament. From 1368 to 1532 this cumbrous
method was maintained, although the membership
of the committee of the "Lords Auditors"
was frequently altered, and the acts of parliament
contain many references to their sitting.
James I introduced a modification into the
system. In 1425 the lord chancellor and
"sundry discreet persons" of the Estates received
power to "examine, conclude, and finally
determine" all complaints. In the next reign
the judgment of these "lords of session" was
declared to be as decisive as that of the Lords
Auditors themselves. In 1503 the judicial work
of the King's Secret Council was organized and
a co-ordinate court was instituted, chosen by the
king, and endowed with full powers, so that
there were three courts of justice to deal with
the numberless grievances of the lieges. The
judicial system took its final shape from France.
In 1532 King James V proposed "to institute
ane college of cunning and wise men baith of
spiritual and temporale estate ... to sitt and
decyde upon all actiounis civile." The Estates
thought this "wele consavit"; and accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the cunning and wise men were created into a
College of Justice, with a president at its head.
It was sanctioned by the Pope, and confirmed
by Parliament in 1540, when the Estates granted
"to the President, Vice-President, and the
Senators power to make such acts, statutes, and
ordinances, as they shall think expedient for
ordering of process and hasty expedition of
Justice." It then consisted of a president,
with seven spiritual and seven temporal lords of
session,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> and, with slight modifications, the Court
of Session continues to decide all civil cases in
Scotland. It represents the Lords Auditors or
the original committee of the Estates to which
judicial powers were entrusted, and not the
judicial work of the Secret Council. So strongly
was it felt that the College of Justice was a
committee of Estates, that, at first, it did not
sit during the meeting of Parliament, which
the Lords of Session were expected to attend.
Exceptions to the rule occur frequently, and as
early as 1538. The High Court of Justiciary
was instituted by James VI in 1587, to supersede
the old jurisdiction of the justiciar, and was
remodelled in the reign of Charles II.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>6. We know, from various sources, something
of the pomp and circumstance which accompanied
a meeting of Parliament. The dress of
the members was strictly prescribed,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and formed
often the most expensive item<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> in a member's
account-book. The Stewart sovereigns, with
scarcely an exception, loved display, and the
meeting of the three Estates afforded an unusually
good opportunity. Queen Mary's personal
beauty gave an additional splendour to
the meeting of Parliament in 1563, and as she
rode in procession the populace of the capital
could not restrain their enthusiasm, and hailed
her with shouts of applause, "God save that
sweet face!"<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Her son took strong measures to
prevent what he termed the decay of the majesty
of his parliament. In 1600 he enjoined that all
members "rydand on horseback, clad with fut
mantellis, and utheris abuilzementis and clething
requisit for the honour of the present actioun,
repair, attend, and accompany his Majesty" to
and from Holyrood and the Tolbooth, "and that
nane schaw themselves unhorsit or vantand fut
mantellis under the pane of tinsell of thair vot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and place."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> The procession was marshalled in
reverse order of precedence. First came the
commissioners of burghs in their black gowns.
They were followed by the commissioners of
barons, members of the privy council, and officers
of state not being lords. The clergy came
next, priors, bishops, and abbots, being alike
attired in silk gowns, and immediately after
them, lords and earls with their mantles of
velvet. Trumpeters preceded pursuivants and
heralds, and the Lord-Lyon-King-at-Arms in his
gorgeous apparel, walking "him alane," immediately
in front of the honours of Scotland.
Behind his sword, sceptre, and crown, rode the
king himself, between the captain of his guard and
the constable of the kingdom. The chancellor
and the great chamberlain were in immediate
attendance upon their master. Last of all came
the marquesses and the royal household. After
the Reformation the work of Parliament was invariably
preceded by a sermon. When the full
Parliament met again to ratify the proceedings of
the Lords of the Articles, the "Lyon Herauld"
solemnly presented the sceptre to the king, who
touched the articles. Prayers followed, and the
House was dissolved. It was small wonder that
the citizens of Edinburgh felt some regret when
the glory of the Parliament House departed.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<h2 class="p4">II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Influence of Parliament</span></h2>

<p class="pn p2">When the Great Council developed into what
we understand by the word "parliament," it
took its place as one of a series of competitors
for the chief power in the kingdom. The king's
prerogative was sufficient to cover everything
that he was able to do, and an undefined law
of treason<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> gave him a valuable weapon, which
he did not fail to use. The most notable danger
to the prerogative was the supersession of the
royal power by the rise of certain noble families
from time to time. The strength of these nobles
lay in the number of their retainers, over whom
they had absolute power. Most of them were
hereditary sheriffs of their own districts, and it
was rarely that either king or parliament ventured
seriously to interfere with their judicial powers.</p>

<p>The Parliament found an additional rival in
the Secret&mdash;afterwards called the Privy&mdash;Council,
which formed the Executive of the realm. Little
is known of the early history of this important
body. Its origin has generally been ascribed
to the Parliament of 1369, which, as we have
seen (cf. pp. 40, 41), appointed a Committee to
discuss certain matters before they came before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> This, however, refers to the Lords
of the Articles, and when the Committee of the
Articles was appointed two years later, the precedent
of 1369 was avowedly followed. It is
not, therefore, possible to identify this body with
the king's secret council, mentioned two years
later, when urgent private business, relating to
the succession, was discussed "in the king's
secret chamber in his secret council,"<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> as contrasted
with the king's chamber of public Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
This allusion to a secret council probably
indicates not the origin, but the existence,
of such a secret council of royal advisers as must
have come into being centuries before. The
small place held by the Parliament in the government
of the country left the Executive or Secret
Council a still more valuable instrument for those
in power, and it is impossible that the kings of
Scotland did not possess a private council before
1369. The next definite reference is in 1389;
when the Duke of Rothesay was appointed
regent for Robert III (cf. p. 75), his power was
limited by a council, of which eighteen members
were appointed by the Estates&mdash;probably an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
enlarged form of the Secret Council.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> But this
was only a temporary arrangement, and it is very
doubtful if Mr. Hill Burton is right in treating
the King's Secret Council as one of "the three
great Committees of Parliament."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It is more
natural to regard it as analogous to the English
Curia Regis, and not ultimately connected with
parliamentary institutions. Like the English
Curia Regis, it exercised judicial powers from
an early period, probably in connection with its
general work of administrative order. It is not
easy to distinguish between the jurisdiction of
the Council, and that of the Lords Auditors,
or Committee of Parliament, elected from 1369
onwards,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> to decide legal cases, and a further
complication arises from the additional Committee
of the Estates, appointed by James I in
1425.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The jurisdiction of the Council in matters
of litigation was further defined by James IV,
who, in an act of 1503, provided that "there
be a council chosen by the King's Highness,
which shall sit continually in Edinburgh or
where the king makes residence or where he
pleases, and decide all manner of summons and
civil matters, complaints, and causes, daily, when
they shall occur, so that there shall not be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
great confusion of summons to call at the
session"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> of the Lords Auditors, or Judicial
Committee of the Estates. We are probably
right in connecting this council, chosen by the
king, with the judicial powers of the Lords of
Secret Council, and it may be an imitation of
the English Courts of King's Bench and Common
Pleas. The special powers of this body came to
an end with the establishment of the Court of
Session.</p>

<p>The constitution of the Secret Council, as an
executive body, was the subject of legislation
during the temporary rise of the importance of
Parliament in the beginning of the reign of
James IV.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In 1489 the King's Council was
chosen in Parliament. Its numbers were increased,
and an act was passed that this council
should act as the advisers of the king till the next
meeting of Parliament, and should be "responsable
and accusable to the king and his Estates."
They were appointed to deal, not only with
justice, but also with all matters concerning the
sovereign or the realm. A quorum consisted
of six members, of whom the Chancellor must
be one. But there is no second instance of a
parliamentary choice of the members of the
Secret Council, nor any indication of any control
over them, and, as we have just seen, the
members of the Secret Council sitting for judicial
purpose were, on the creation of the committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in 1503, selected by the king alone. Thus
matters continued till the minority of James
V, when Council and Parliament alike became
the object of the intrigues of the factions who
were struggling for power, and the Estates were,
as usual, powerless. In 1524 the Lords of the
Articles chose the Lords of the Secret Council,
and in 1528, when the Earl of Arran was in
power, he obtained the election, in Parliament,
of a Council to advise the king, and of a smaller
Secret Council, from both of which the leader
of the opposite party, Archbishop Beaton, was
excluded. When the records of the Privy
Council begin, in 1545, the council was a
small body of advisers of the queen-mother and
the regent, and there is no evidence that the
Act of 1489 was ever really in operation. The
Register shows that the council possessed very
full executive powers, and it continued to carry
on the real government of the country. Its
numbers increased during the minority of James
VI, the circumstances of which differed widely
from those of any previous minority, and, in
1598, the king succeeded in reducing the number
of its members to thirty-one, and in rendering
it completely dependent on the Crown, while,
at the same time, he made it, as far as he could,
the paramount authority in the land, not only
in matters pertaining to the Executive, but also
in connection with justice. It was in no sense
a Court of Appeal; but it not infrequently reversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
judgments of the Court of Session, and
sometimes dictated their course of action to the
judges. Any such interference arose, however,
from the plenary powers of the council as an
executive body. After James's accession to the
English throne, the Privy Council became the
mere instrument of the king's will, and dared
in no way to oppose him, while he, on his part,
treated it with scant respect or courtesy. At
the outbreak of the troubles in the reign of
Charles I, it was prominent in opposing the
king; but it was afterwards eclipsed by the Parliamentary
Committees and by the Assembly.
After the Restoration it became again an instrument
of absolute monarchy, but from the
Revolution to the Union of the Parliaments it
possessed very important powers.</p>

<p>With this preface, we may proceed to our main
issue: what was the influence exerted by the
Scottish Parliament, thus constituted, governed
by such rules of procedure as we have described,
and surrounded by so many powerful rivals?
The early laws which have come down to us as
illustrating the powers of the Great Council are
mainly concerned&mdash;like so many later enactments&mdash;with
matters of administrative detail.
The assizes of William the Lion deal largely
with merchandise and the rights and obligations
of merchants, and scarcely fall within our province.
The work of the Great Council, up to
the War of Independence, was to deal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
police and judicial administration, to settle feudal
claims and obligations, and to make grants
to the king. We find the council consulted on
marriage treaties (<i>e.g.</i> in 1153 and in 1295); but
marriage treaties involved expenditure. The
task of advising the king and of carrying on
the government must have belonged to a select
council of which our constitutional documents
bear no trace.</p>

<p>In the reign of Robert the Bruce, as we find
the first advance in membership we meet also
the first indications of a growth of power. His
parliaments took measures for the security and
defence of the kingdom; they passed laws regulating
the succession; they established the English
principle involved in the writs of Novel
Disseisin and Mort d'ancestor; they addressed
the Pope on the subject of the English claims,
and told him of their great deliverance at the
hands of King Robert. The great parliament
of 1326 made a bargain with the king. In
consideration of the "many hardships he had
sustained both in person and goods," during
his ten years' conflict with the invaders, they
granted him "the tenth penny of all their fermes
and rents, as well of demesne lands and wards
as of their other lands." The collection was to
be made by the king's officers; and all who
claimed liberties promised faithfully to pay the
proper sum to the royal servants. The grant
was made only for the king's life, and two conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were attached to it. Any remission made
by the king would invalidate the whole grant.
The king must not impose any further taxes
(except, of course, the ordinary feudal dues), nor
must he take prisage or carriage, except on a
journey, and, even then, not without payment.
In the last parliament of the reign, the treaty
of Northampton, by which England acknowledged
the independence of Scotland, was discussed.</p>

<p>The first reign in which the term parliament is
really applicable is that of King Robert. At the
very beginning of parliamentary history in Scotland,
we have, then, distinct precedents for three
important constitutional rights&mdash;the regulation of
the succession, participation in the settlement of
foreign affairs, and powers of taxation. If we
could regard these as having been claimed by
Parliament with consciousness of their full significance,
and admitted by the Crown, we might
fairly join with the older historians in urging
that Scotland can be said to have anticipated
the parliamentary institutions of England. The
explanation lies in the circumstances of the
reign. The king's title consisted in his leadership
in his glorious war. The succession was
uncertain; the Crown was poor; the nation was
loyal. A writer on the English constitution
could take these three points of which we have
spoken, and trace their history through the
centuries. Such a method would be futile here.
These rights, and all other rights, stand or fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
together. We can scarcely draw the wonted
distinction between political and constitutional
history. At times, we have neither, in any strict
national sense; only family and personal history.</p>

<p class="b1">The leprosy-stricken age of King Robert was
cheered by two important events&mdash;the birth of
an heir, and the acknowledgment of the national
independence. When he sank into the grave,
he left the heritage of the nation's freedom, and
the guardianship of his son, to the loyalty of the
nobles. It was an opportunity for Parliament
to make good its position. But, as we have
already seen, the precedent of 1326 was assumed
to be valid only for the raising of money, and
the "Parliament" was, at first, only the old
council. The political events of the beginning
of the reign relate chiefly to the attempt made
by England to place Edward Balliol on the
Scottish throne, as a vassal-king. When that
design had been, not without some difficulty,
defeated, we find the Parliament, without the
burgesses, conducting all the affairs of the kingdom,
and acting, for almost the only time in
Scottish history, as the executive. It granted
lands and charters; passed ordinances regarding
the Staple; arranged (with the co-operation of
the burghs) the treaty of peace with England
and the ransom of the king; settled the privileges
of the church and of the burghs, with which the
king had been tampering; made provisions for
the Highlands and Islands; and decided the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
mode of succession. This, however, is not
parliamentary government, though it is more like
it than anything else in Scottish history before
the revolution of 1640. The king was at the
first an infant, and afterwards a prisoner, and
his character was at all times weak and contemptible.
The nobles were divided by feuds.
Nobody was strong enough to make himself
supreme. The country was governed by a committee
of the nobles. Still, the reign of David
II made two contributions to such constitutional
theory as Scotland possessed. One of these is
an emphatic reiteration of what had been done
in the preceding reign. After his return from
England, David, in pursuance of a private agreement
with Edward III, attempted to persuade
the Estates to acknowledge Prince Lionel of
England as his heir. The account given of the
affair by Wyntoun<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> is notable as the first report
of a debate in the Parliament of Scotland:</p>

<p class="ppq20">
"That ilke yere quhen that wes don,<br />
A Parliament gart he hald at Scone.<br />
Thare til the Statis of his land,<br />
That in counsal ware sittand,<br />

Quhen this denyit was utraly,<br />
The King wes rycht wa and angry;<br />
Bot his yarnyng nevyrtheles<br />
Denyit off al his liegis wes."</p>

<p class="p1">The words of the original Act are quite as
emphatic.</p>

<p>The Parliament of 1326 had declared that any
personal remission of taxation by the king would
render the whole grant null and void. The
Parliament of 1369 went much further. It enacted
that no remission granted by the king to
a convicted offender should have any force, and
it asserted that any writ of the king was invalid
which contradicted any statute or was not in
accordance with the common law of the realm.
This constitutional statement marks the "highest"
doctrine propounded by the Scottish Parliament
till the seventeenth century. While it is necessary
to guard against laying too much stress on the
history of the reign of David II as illustrating
the growth of strictly constitutional and parliamentary
principles, it would be erring on the
other side to deny that here we have a distinct
assertion of principle. We have been forced to
discount much of the recorded action of Parliament,
on the ground that it is merely an instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of a number of nobles uniting to do what none
of them was powerful enough to do alone. But
the Parliament of 1369 contained burgesses (at
least on the roll of its members); and the
wording of its resolution is distinctly suggestive
of the existence of some constitutional feeling.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
The weakness and unpopularity of the king must
be allowed due weight on the other hand; and
the tone of the record suggests a jealous interference
with the personal schemes of the king
rather than any broader view of rights.</p>

<p>With the ignominious reign of David II the
direct line of King Robert the Bruce came to an
end. The question of the succession had already
been settled by the Parliament in favour of King
Robert's grandson, Robert, the High Steward of
Scotland, son of Marjory Bruce and Walter the
Steward. We know that Robert had been a prominent
figure during the reign of his uncle, and
that David II regarded him with no good will.
The reign of Robert II is one of the periods of
Scottish history which stand in need of more
thorough investigation. We possess no account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of it that is in any way satisfactory. There are
wars and rumours of wars; vague traditions of
conspiracies; dim hints of a constitutional conflict
between the Estates and the King. No
figure stands out pre-eminently from the crowd;
no man of the time left any impression on succeeding
generations. The one event that has
given significance to the name of Robert II is
the "hontynge of the Cheviot," the battle where
the dead Douglas won the field. Two points
demand notice from a constitutional stand-point.
The family difficulties of the king led to the
establishment of the succession by the Estates.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
But the crown was entailed in accordance with
the king's wish, and the fact affords no indication
of the power of Parliament. In the second place
the early years of the reign mark the renewal of
a definite alliance with France, of the circumstances
of which we know but little. The instructions
to the ambassadors contain a mention of the
consent of the <i>prelati proceres et tota communitas
regni</i> to the proposal for a Franco-Scottish league;
and one of the conditions of its acceptance was
that the Scottish Parliament alone should decide
a disputed succession without French interference&mdash;clearly
a reminiscence of the pretext of which
Edward I of England had availed himself. The
French negotiations led to an <i>imbroglio</i> with
England, to which undue weight has been attached.
Robert had, in 1383, agreed to a truce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with England. A number of his nobles, mainly
to amuse a band of French knights, made a raid
into the northern counties, in revenge for a recent
English incursion. There is no reference to the
affair in the Scots Acts. Froissart gives the most
detailed account; and there seems to be no reason
to attach to it any constitutional value whatsoever.
Tytler, whose <i>History</i> is still in many ways our
best authority, merely remarks that "These were
not the days when Scottish barons, having resolved
upon war, stood upon much ceremony,
either as to the existence of a truce, or the commands
of a sovereign."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Hill Burton, following
Buchanan, regards the incident as the first of
a series of instances showing that the power of
peace and war was throughout Scottish history
"jealously retained by the Estates."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> We shall
have occasion to refer to the other statements
on which this bold generalization is grounded.
Meanwhile, it is sufficient to say that three years
previously, an agreement for a truce had been
made at a private meeting between John of
Gaunt and the Earl of Carrick, King Robert's
eldest son; and we have no evidence that anyone
thought of consulting the Estates at all.</p>

<p>During the latter half of his reign, the king
was rendered quite incapable both in body and
mind by some disease, the nature of which is
uncertain. For a few years, therefore, there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
considerable parliamentary activity. A laudable
effort was made to restore order in the north, by
sending Carrick to deal with the rebellious lords.
We do not know how far he was successful. He
was soon afterwards temporarily disabled by an
accident, and his brother, the Earl of Fife,
succeeded to his place. These years are marked
by certain police measures, and by efforts to
suppress private feuds and carry out the decisions
of the law courts. It is scarcely possible to say
whether Parliament gained or lost ground under
Robert II. It is the transition period between
the great council of the reign of David II and
the rise of individual nobles which alternated
with intervals of regal government from the
reign of Robert III to that of James VI.</p>

<p>The change of Carrick's name from "John,"
hateful by reason of its association with Balliol,
to that of the hero of Bannockburn, could not
avail to alter the weak disposition and character
of the new monarch. The first years of the
reign were free from conflict with the troublesome
neighbour in the south; but they were
years of internal feud, almost of anarchy. The
career of the Wolf of Badenoch is typical of the
time. Possibly the mysterious combat at Perth,
where Hal o' the Wynd carved for himself a
path to fame, is connected with some attempt
to introduce order. Parliament met during
these years only to sanction charters and other
formal documents. But the meeting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Estates in 1398 is a distinct epoch in the story.
Burton<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> tells us that "At length the cry of
the nation reached and was re-echoed by the
Estates in Parliament"; that, although "in this
assembly were those who had been the most
flagrant and powerful transgressors, yet the
Parliament collectively emphatically denounced
the evils of the day and sought to find a remedy
for them"; and that "no one who could have
checked the mischief was spared." If we could
accept this view of the situation, it would be
an interesting exception to the common belief
that an individual may have a conscience, but
a body of councillors has none. But Burton's
characterization of this parliament is, <i>pace tanti
viri</i>, a psychological impossibility. He founds
his interpretation upon the often quoted Act
which attributed to the king all responsibility
for the misgovernment of the realm, and called
upon him, if he desired to exculpate himself, to
show that the blame lay with his officers. The
Duke of Rothesay was appointed regent, and
he was instructed to consult a council of "wise
and leal men." We are not informed under
what auspices the parliament met. But it is
certain that the king was not responsible for
his actions, and that the anarchy was largely
due to the rivalry of the Duke of Rothesay, the
king's eldest son, and the Duke of Albany, a
brother of King Robert, who, as Earl of Fife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
had held the title of "Governor" in the end of
the "preceding" reign. They and they alone could
have "checked the mischief." The probability
is that the meeting of Parliament was really
an incident in their struggle for power; that
Rothesay was powerful enough to secure the
regency; and that Albany succeeded in circumscribing
his power by a council and by a decision
that Parliament was to be summoned once a
year. But it is not necessary to allow even this
importance to the appointment of a yearly parliament.
The Act says that the king shall hold a
parliament "swa that his subjects be servit of the
law." It was to meet merely to overtake its
judicial work&mdash;the decisions in feudal quarrels
and on complaints of robbery and oppression.
Our explanation of the <i>motif</i> of the meeting of
the Estates of 1398 receives some confirmation
from subsequent events&mdash;the misgovernment of
Rothesay, his imprisonment by the Duke of
Albany, his mysterious death, and the peaceful
succession of Albany to the governorship without,
so far as the records go, any appointment
by the Estates whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The view we have
taken seems the most probable when we consider
the circumstances, the composition of Parliament,
and the whole tone of the reign. It is,
however, not incompatible with an acknowledgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that there possibly existed in 1398 a neutral
party which was able to wield a certain influence
in the fierce division of parties. It is noteworthy
that a resolution was passed that the names of
Rothesay's councillors who agreed to an act of
government should be recorded, so that he and
they alike might be responsible to the Estates.
It would be rash to speak dogmatically in the
present condition of our knowledge. There is
a strong temptation to accept this as a constitutional
movement; but it must be remembered
that it is at least equally probable that we have
here a device by which Albany aimed at ridding
himself on the first opportunity of his reckless
and dissipated nephew and of that nephew's
favourite counsellors.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The great pitfall of Scottish
historians has been to read later or foreign
ideas into the scanty records of the national
history.</p>

<p>If they are right who argue that under David
II and the two Roberts we have a discernible
impulse towards parliamentary government, we
certainly lose all trace of it after the death of
the Duke of Rothesay. The Duke of Albany
kept complete control of the country till his death
in 1419, when he was succeeded by his son, without
any trace of parliamentary sanction. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
government of the first Albany was firm, but he
ruled as absolute master. A parliament had met
in 1402, before Rothesay's death, and had passed
some useful acts for the maintenance of internal
order, probably under Albany's guidance. The
most important of these refer to justice, and
illustrate the difficulty of dealing with hereditary
sheriffs. While the country was divided between
Rothesay and Albany, Parliament still had a
place. After Rothesay's death it practically
disappears till a great council was summoned
in 1423 to discuss the propositions for the king's
return, which involved the question of a ransom.</p>

<p>Under the personal rule of James I we have
the best instance in Scottish history of government
in accordance with what would now be
called the theory of the Scottish constitution.
But it was not "constitutional government" in
our modern derived sense of the word. The
Parliament was not intended to be the ruling
body. King James was a masterful man, and
he aimed at using the Parliament as the best
means of creating a powerful monarchy, not at
giving it a power to rival his own. His experience
immediately on his return does not strengthen
our belief in the "Parliamentarianism" of the
preceding century. He found it impossible to
persuade the smaller barons to attend, even by
deputy, and he had to threaten with the penalties
of treason his great lords who declined to be
present. The burgesses alone seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
regarded with sympathy his meditated reorganization
of the kingdom. The acts of his reign
provided for the defence of the country on the
analogy of the English Assize of Arms. They
dealt with labour disputes; they instituted the
system of licensed beggars to which we are
indebted for Edie Ochiltree, and forbade anyone
to beg between the ages of fourteen and seventy.
The numerous Parliaments that met between
1424 and 1437 are full of police regulations, some
of them petty enough, but all bearing the impress
of the master-mind of the king. He vindicated
his orthodoxy by enactments against Lollardry,
while he emulated the English kings in their prohibitions
of papal interference.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But, above all,
the reign is memorable for the king's attempt to
enforce justice.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> His great difficulty lay in the
independence of the sheriffs, who continued to
impede all improvements for three centuries after
his death. The history of Scotland is full of
complaints on this subject. "The greatest
hindrance to the execution of our lawes in this
countrie," wrote a later king, "are these heritable
Shiredomes and Regalities, which being in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hands of the great men, do wracke the whole
countrie."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It was more easy to ordain frequent
sessions of "the Chancellor and discreet persons,"
to forbid riding to the court "with multitudes of
folkis na with armys," and to threaten the punishment
of negligent sheriffs, than to carry out these
schemes. The only guarantee for their receiving
any obedience lay in the personal strength of the
king. With the tragedy at Perth, which rendered
the Christmas of 1437 for ever memorable, the
great plans of the first James lost all chance of
fruition. Parliament had done good work during
his reign. It had conferred a legality on his
ordinances which rendered them less the creatures
of the royal will and weakened the protests of
the nobles against the king's tyranny.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> But we
cannot reasonably credit the Estates with any
initiative. The acts are the king's acts. Even
the judges&mdash;the lords of session&mdash;were no longer
elected by Parliament; they were chosen by the
king.</p>

<p class="b1">From the murder of King James I to the commencement
of the personal rule of his son, Parliament
rarely met, and there is no evidence of any
activity. The minority was occupied with the
miserable rivalry of Crichton and Livingston,
and with schemes for preventing the undue
growth of the power of the house of Douglas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
It is an illustration of how far Scotland was
from possessing a parliamentary theory, that
Douglas was credited with an intention of setting
up a Parliament of his own. His aim seems
to have been to create for himself a sort of kingdom
with some vague feudal dependence on the
King of Scotland. Beyond some administrative
acts of 1449, there is no parliamentary progress
to record till after the second and final defeat of
the great House in 1454. The Douglas influence
was so strong in 1449 that they passed an act
which rendered it lawful to seize by force, with
the consent of the three Estates, the person of
the young king, who was growing restive under
the Douglas domination.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> When James of the
Fiery Face at last succeeded in throwing off the
yoke, he set himself to carry out the work that
his father had left unfinished. His legislation
covers some pages on the statute book. But it
is mainly a repetition of the work of James I,
and many of the acts are really decisions in
private cases. Pitscottie<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> describes to us the
suitors that thronged when Parliament met&mdash;"widows,
bairns, and infants, seeking redress for
their husbands, kindred, and friends that were
cruelly slain by wicked bloody murderers." The
reign is not devoid of some progress in justice
and police regulations. But it exemplifies the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
tendency of the Scots Parliament to exercise the
functions merely of a court of justice. Under
good influence, like that of James II and Bishop
Kennedy, it decided causes in favour of the poor
and the oppressed, and made general regulations
to meet all such cases in the future. Under the
influence of some ambitious nobleman, it passed
partisan measures which rendered legal his treatment
of his opponents. King James VI<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> did
not speak purely out of prejudice against the
power of parliaments when, years before the
fateful journey that brought him into contact
with the English Commons, he wrote:</p>

<p class="pbq">As a Parliament is honourablest and highest judgement in
the land&mdash;if it be well used&mdash;so is it the injustest judgement
seat that may be being abused to men's particulars; irrevocable
decreets against particular parties being given therein,
under colour of generall lawes, and oft-times the Estates not
knowing themselves whom they hurt.</p>

<p class="p1">The credit of the wise legislation which marked
the last six years of the life of James II belongs
to the king and the Bishop Kennedy of St.
Andrews. Parliament was merely a good tool
in wise hands. There is no proof that it ever
really decided&mdash;or even had a voice in deciding&mdash;anything
of importance. In March, 1457-58, all
the leading acts of the reign were confirmed, and
the Estates petitioned the sovereign "with all
humilitie ... to be inclynit with silk diligence
to the execucione of these statutis, acts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
decretis above writtyn that God may be emplesit
of him," and congratulated him on the peace of
the realm. Two years later, in prosecuting a war<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
with "our enemy of England," James, "more
curious than became him or the majesty of a
king," was watching the firing of a cannon,
before Roxburgh Castle, when it exploded, and
Scotland was again plunged into the troubles
of a minority.</p>

<p>The death of the king made at first but little
difference to the conduct of affairs. Bishop
Kennedy continued to rule till his death, in 1465.
No sooner did the statesman and patriot disappear
from the scene than a coalition headed
by Lord Boyd seized the young monarch, and
carried him in triumph from Linlithgow to Edinburgh.
A parliament was at once summoned to
sanction their proceedings. The king was made
to declare that he had gone willingly, and the
Estates created Boyd James's governor, and
somewhat illogically granted him a full pardon.
Under the sway of the Boyds, Parliament met
every year; but it was merely a tool in the hands
of Lord Boyd, who combined in his own person
the offices of governor of the royal family, justiciar,
and lord chamberlain. In 1469 the Boyds
fell. A strong rival party had formed an opposition
of which we find traces all through the
brief term of power enjoyed by Boyd. It is
significant that this opposition is found everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
except in Parliament, which unanimously
agreed to measures against the malcontents.
The parliamentary tactics of the Boyds were
used against themselves. A meeting of the
Estates was at once called by the king, now
under the influence of Lord Hamilton, and the
whole of the late ruling faction were condemned
to the penalties of treason, on the ground of the
king's seizure, for which the same body had,
three years before, solemnly pardoned them.
Their vast possessions were confiscated. The
Hamiltons, who had gained the confidence of
the young queen, continued to rule. So far
the political history of the reign is clear, and
the position of Parliament falls at once into line
with it. But we dare not attempt to unravel
the tale of intrigue which convulsed the country
during the next twenty years. The reign of
James III is an unsolved problem. But the
constitutional feeling may be illustrated by a
representative incident. The Parliament of 1482
was completely under the control of the Duke
of Albany. The Estates passed acts which
gave to him control of the property of the
Crown, and power over the life and liberty of
the lieges. One year later it rescinded all these
acts and proscribed the duke. They may be
right who have found great constitutional activity
in the mysterious records of the reign. It may
be that amid all the disorder and confusion the
burgesses and some neutral prelates were able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to exercise some influence. It is certain that
there was as usual no lack of attention to judicial
and police requirements. But until some intelligible
and consistent account of the reign has
been offered, the sceptic may be pardoned for
refusing to believe that out of these unruly
struggles of selfish and grasping lords came
calm constitutional progress.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p class="b1">The rebellion in which James III lost his life
was, as usual, discussed in Parliament: that is
to say, the first Parliament of the new reign
declared that it was not a rebellion at all, and
that, whatever it was, the new monarch and his
advisers were not responsible for it. At first,
James IV was in the hands of the nobles who
had persuaded him to enter the field against
his father. His second Parliament is memorable
for a claim raised by the Lords of the Articles
"that Compts and Rekyning be takin of all
the king's officiaris, his thesaurars and comptrollers,
auld and new of our soverane lord's
tyme that now is and that auditors be chosen
and named by the avise and autorite of this
Parliament." This is not the tone in which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
have been accustomed to hear the Parliament
speak. It is coincident with the appointment
in Parliament of "our Sovereign Lord's Secret
Council," and with a resolution that the king
has "humilit his highness," so far as to promise
to act by its advice. The council was composed
solely of prelates and great lords representing
mainly the party in power, although including
the patriotic bishop of Aberdeen,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> who had been
a faithful servant of James III. We have here
a distinct constitutional advance. The king
owed his power, not to a small clique such as
had been frequently formed in the late reign,
but to a large confederation of the greater nobles,
who took the opportunity of legally defining the
position of the sovereign. But within a few years
we find James ruling alone. He was an able
man and he ruled well. The Parliament met
frequently and did what the king wished. We
find in its records references to embassies to
Spain, France, and England, and to the king's
marriage. But we know, from the foreign correspondence
of England and Spain, that the
policy of Scotland depended upon the king, and
on him alone. Parliament regulated in certain
cases the incidence of taxation: at all events it
passed acts for this purpose. Contemporaries
did not imagine that the Estates alone had
powers of taxation. John Major,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> writing a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
years after the strong hand of James IV had been
removed, made this remark:</p>

<p class="pbq">As to the levying of taxes, I will limit my opinion to this
expression: that in no wise should the power be granted to
kings save in cases of clear necessity. Further it belongs
not to the king nor to his privy council to declare the emergence
of any sudden necessity but only to the three estates....
I am aware that Aristotle in his second book of the
<i>Politics</i> says wisely that laws are not to be changed; yet, in
the judgment of the wise, they may be modified in accordance
with the demands of equity.</p>

<p class="pn p1">Major remarks on the difficulty of collecting taxes
in Scotland and on the folly of the kings in alienating
confiscated estates, "since there is no regular
taxation of the people." His remedy is, as we
have seen, the regulation of taxation by Parliament.
He was a scholar and a traveller, and
it matters not how he came to think as he did;
but it is clear that he advocated a change.</p>

<p>Nor did James regard the Estates as possessing
"powers of peace and war." Pedro de Ayala<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
tells us of a conversation which he held with the
king which gives us the royal views: "He said
to me that his subjects serve him with their persons
and goods, in just and unjust quarrels,
exactly as he likes, and that therefore he does
not think it right to begin any warlike undertaking
without being himself the first in danger."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Boece, in his biography of Elphinstone,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> tells us
of councils which preceded Flodden: but they
are meetings of the king's private advisers. It
is instructive to note that one parliament was held
with reference to the English war. About a fortnight
before the battle, what is termed "Parliament"
was held at Twiselhaugh. It was composed
of "all his lords being there for the time in his
host," and it secured that the heirs of all who
were slain should be exempted by the king from
certain feudal dues. The exemption can only
have been the king's own act. It is an additional
testimony to the purpose for which the Scots Parliament
normally existed&mdash;to ratify what somebody
else had done. If there are vestiges of constitutional
claims at the opening of the reign, there are
none at the end of it. But though the Parliament
had not been free, neither had it been idle. It
was a time of unusual prosperity and of great
expansion of trade. The pages of the statute-books
are full of useful acts, especially for the
encouragement of shipping, in which the king
was greatly interested.</p>

<p>While the "lilt of dule and woe" which followed
the disaster at Flodden was still filling the land,
the country was again plunged into the misery of
feudal quarrels. The ambition of the lords, and
the caprices of the queen-mother&mdash;a true sister
of Henry VIII&mdash;fill up the minority of the king.
Parliament met only to ratify appointments which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
it had no power to question, and to deal with
official business. It is possible that the Estates
chose the Duke of Albany as regent. But it is
almost certain that the impulse must have come
from some of the leading nobles or prelates; and
when we recollect that the "Estates" meant the
Lords of the Articles, it is scarcely necessary to
discuss the matter as presenting even the remotest
possibility of a parliamentary choice. James V
was nominally declared of full age in 1524. But
he was then only thirteen years of age, and the
"erection of the king" was merely a pretext for
the transference of the power from Albany to
Queen Margaret, the Parliament of course approving,
when it was told to do so. Until the
king became personally responsible for the
government, there was little done in Parliament.
If we except a slight activity in 1526 (mainly
relating to such incidental matters as the capture
of ships and the furnishing of the royal residences),
there is scarcely anything to record till
we reach the year 1535. Parliament met; but
its business was purely of an official nature.
All that we know of the Parliament of May,
1527, for example, is that it issued two continuations
of summons, one "reduction" of a
process of forfeiture, eleven ratifications of charters,
and received four protestations. A single
official, appointed for the purpose, could have
done all the work.</p>

<p>James V is known in history as the "Commons'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
King." We are therefore prepared to
find during the five years of his personal government
a considerable amount of social legislation
of the ordinary type, dealing often with trivial
details, which show that the burgesses were in
co-operation with the king. But of parliamentary
interference there is not a trace. The hostilities
with the "auld enemy," a mischance in which
broke the king's heart, seem not to have been
referred to the Estates in any way. The reign
of James V was contemporaneous with the English
Reformation, and before the king died the
new doctrines had gained considerable strength
in Scotland. But James himself, after his alliance
with the House of Guise, had become more
rigidly orthodox, and his last Parliament passed
acts enjoining obedience to the Pope, the worship
of the Virgin Mary, and prohibiting any
convention to discuss Scripture. The royal influence
was supreme.</p>

<p>The stories of the minorities of James II,
James III, and James V read almost like repetitions
of each other. The names and dates vary;
the essential facts are the same. The minority
of Queen Mary is widely different. The difficulties
no longer arise from petty squabbles
and contemptible personal intrigues. There is
a deeper significance in every movement. It is
a conflict, not of men, but of principles. On
the one hand was the ancient French alliance,
associated with the ancient faith. On the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
hand stood the possibility of new relations with
England and the acceptance of the Reformed
doctrines. At first the revolutionary party held
the power. The Scottish nobles had observed
the English king's dealings with the lands of the
Church. In Scotland there was no masterful
Tudor to enrich himself. We find accordingly
the acceptance of the marriage proposals of
Henry VIII, and, significantly enough, among
the domestic legislation of the time is an act
making it lawful "to haif the haly write, baith
the new testament and the auld in the vulgar
toung in Englis or Scottis of ane gude and trew
translation."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The "English wooing," which
passed into a proverb in Scotland, did not merely
put an end to the suggestion of a marriage between
Queen Mary and Edward VI; it altered
the situation in Scotland, and deprived the reforming
section of their hopes of success, by
forcing the nation into a French alliance. In
1545, Parliament, always obedient, inveighed
against "heretiks and thair dampnable opinionis
incontrar the fayth and lawis of halykirk." But
it was not till the regency was transferred from
the Earl of Arran (now Duke of Chatelhérault)
to the queen-dowager (in 1554) that the success
of the conservative section in the realm was
complete. "Thus," wrote Knox, in reference
to the event, "did light and darkness stryve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
within the realm of Scotland; the darkness ever
befoir the world suppressing the light." The
reservation, "befoir the world," is significant.
Knox knew that every year since the death of
James V had added converts, ever increasing in
number, to the new faith. But all the time
Parliament became more and more rigidly orthodox.</p>

<p>The struggle between the two parties found
an issue in open warfare. The Protestants formed
themselves into "the Congregation of the Lord."
But they did not look upon Parliament<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> as the
proper field for their contest with "the Synagogue
of Satan." The insurgents and their
English allies gained no success on the field;
but the death of Mary of Guise and the absence
of her daughter in France procured for them
the results of victory. Scotland was definitely
in the hands of the Protestant nobles.</p>

<p class="b1">Parliament met in 1560, and abolished the
Roman Catholic faith within the realm. But,
as we know from Knox's <i>History</i>, Parliament
merely ratified what was otherwise settled.
Behind it were the nobles and the Protestant
clergy. The ministers petitioned the Estates to
establish the Protestant faith. They were told<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"to draw in playne and severall heidis, the
summe of that Doctrine, quhilk they wald menteyne,
and wald desyre that present Parliament
to establische, as hailsome, trew, and onlie
necessarie to be beleivit and resaivit." Within
four days Knox and his colleagues presented
the very comprehensive Confession of Faith
which continued for nearly a century to be one
of the Standards of the Church. It</p>

<p class="pnbq">was redd, everie article by itself ... and the vottis of everie
man war requyred accordinglie. Of the Temporall Estate
onlie voted in the contrair, the Earl of Atholl, the Lordis
Somervaill and Borthwik; and yit for thair disassenting thei
produced ne better reassone, but "We will beleve as oure
fatheris beleved."</p>

<p class="pn p1">Acts were passed against the mass, and against
papal supremacy.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> But the whole of the desire
of the ministers was not accorded. The First
Book of Discipline did not receive parliamentary
sanction, because it contradicted the views of the
nobles as to the disposal of Church property.</p>

<p>While, then, the Parliament of 1560 was in
some sense the creature of the Assembly, and
though its resolutions were conditioned by the
wishes of the nobility, it occupies a very important
position in Scottish constitutional history.
We do not lay much stress on its opposition to
the sovereigns. That, in itself, was neither novel
nor remarkable in any way. It was obedient to
the powers of the day. But it is the first Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
where the burgesses and the smaller barons
attended and voted in accordance with their own
feeling. They were Protestants and they were
in complete agreement with those who were
guiding the meeting of Estates. It is also the
first Parliament which had the consciousness of
power. They and their leaders were making a
great national change. The people were beginning
to learn what possibilities they possessed.
The Parliament of 1560 was the first step towards
a constitutional theory for Scotland.</p>

<p class="b1">This meeting of the Estates has still another
aspect. It was significant that an assembly of
ecclesiastics drew up the acts by which the
Parliament became famous, for we have here the
first appearance in constitutional history of a
greater than the Parliament. Into the General
Assembly of the Church there soon drifted those
principles and aspirations that might have given
life to the Estates. We shall have occasion to
notice the part taken by the Assembly in the
coming struggles; but it may be well here to
indicate its claims. These claims were not formulated
in 1560. They were of gradual growth.
We find them implicit in the writings of Knox;
but they were first definitely advanced by a man
of no less intellect than the rugged reformer&mdash;Andrew
Melville, the antagonist of James VI.
Melville, in his frequent interviews with the king,
"talkit all his mynd in his awin manner, roundly,
soundly, fully, freely, and fervently." But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
never stated his view in more explicit terms than
on the memorable day when, after calling King
James "God's sillie vassal," he addressed him
thus:</p>

<p class="pnbq">And thairfor, Sir, as divers tymes befor, sa now again, I mon
tell yow, thair is twa Kings and twa Kingdomes in Scotland.
Thair is Chryst Jesus the King, and his Kingdom the Kirk,
whase subject King James the Saxt is: and of whase Kingdom
nocht a King, nor a lord, nor a heid, bot a member.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p class="pn p1">Knox, in his interviews with James's mother, had
taken lower ground. But Melville was not using
idle words. There was no power in the land that
could cope with the Church. From 1567 the
Assembly met some days before the opening of
Parliament, and prepared Church business, which
was generally the principal item on the parliamentary
list of <i>agenda</i>.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> As early as 1565 it sent
Queen Mary an overture against "the papisticall
and blasphemous masse ... not only in the subjects,
but also in the Queen's Majestie's awin
person," and Mary's reply was couched in sufficiently
humble terms.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Two years later it issued
instructions to the Parliament about the ratification
of the Acts of 1560, the question of the
Darnley murder, and the treatment of the young
prince.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> It claimed the old ecclesiastical jurisdiction
in all questions of morality, religion, education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and marriage.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It imprisoned offenders,
and it informed magistrates how they were to act
and threatened them with the censure of the Kirk.
Its sentence of the Greater Excommunication
involved the cessation of human intercourse<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and
the forfeiture of legal rights. The presbyterian
system of Church government, with its careful
distribution of authority, was able to make such
a sentence a terrible reality. Not only the General
Assembly, but the Synod or the Presbytery or the
Kirk Session, was a court of justice. The records
which have been published show with what vigour
their power was used. Men of position and influence
quailed before those stern judges. The
old Church had often been powerful, under a
strong bishop. But the secular forces gained
strength while a see was vacant, and sometimes
secured the appointment of a lay figure. A
Presbytery never died: its members might change,
but it continued its work, calmly and relentlessly,
"grinding exceeding small."</p>

<p>Nor was the power of the Church confined to
criminal jurisdiction. Two instances will serve
to show the extent of its influence. In 1594,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
King James asked the presbytery of Edinburgh
to "procure the leveing of six hundreth footmen,
and four hundreth horsemen" to suppress a rebellion;
and the presbytery complied with his
request.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> At the meeting of the General Assembly
in March, 1596, King James was present. "He
urged a contribution of the whole realme, not to
be lifted presentlie, but when need sould require,"
and, to gain the sympathetic consideration of the
Assembly, he promised that "his chamber doors
sould be made patent to the meanest minister of
Scotland, there sould not be anie meane gentleman
in Scotland more subject to the good order
and discipline of the Kirk than he would be."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
It would be easy to multiply examples.</p>

<p>It was no case of ecclesiastical tyranny. The
leaders of the Church might well apply to themselves
the promise, "a willing people in the day
of thy power." Modern democrats have denounced
the Assembly as the oppressors of a
priest-ridden populace. But the Assembly had
made possible the existence of a public opinion
in Scotland, and the public opinion of Scotland
was with the Assembly. It is true that the documents
to which assent was required appear to us
crowded with metaphysical subtleties, to some
of which no man who valued his freedom of
thought could subscribe; but it must be remembered
that these cast-iron theories registered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the results to which that generation had
attained. Moreover, it was in the Church courts,
first of all, that Scotsmen learned the value and
the power of debate. The Church did for Scotland
what the Parliament accomplished for England.
The Assembly was not a meeting of
ecclesiastics alone. The strength of the Church
lay in the presence of lay members in her courts,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
to which there came earls, lords, and barons,
and commissioners from provinces and universities.
Each member, be he lord or peasant,
the minister of St. Giles, or a Glasgow baillie,
had equal right to speak, and no man's vote
counted for more than that of his neighbour.
The history of Scotland from the Reformation
to the Revolution is the history of the General
Assembly. The motto which it shared with
other reformed churches is the story of the
seventeenth century. <i>Nec tamen consumebatur.</i>
Yet the flames burned fiercely enough.</p>

<p>From what we have said of the Assembly, the
inference as to the Parliament is clear. It
follows that its history between the year of
Queen Mary's return and the day when Andrew
Melville addressed King James in the words we
have quoted is one rather of retrogression than
of progress; nor did it, at any subsequent period,
overawe the General Assembly. Further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
than this point we cannot go in any detail.
The history of Scotland between 1567 and 1707
is so intricate, and has been so thoroughly expounded,
that only a brief concluding sketch is
necessary in a thesis of the present nature, however
essential to a constitutional history of Scotland.
In 1560 it was, to some extent, a free
parliament, as Knox said, and it could claim to
represent popular opinion. During the reign of
Mary, as we have already seen, it relapsed into
its old position of ratifying the acts of the privy
council. Nor was the Parliament which met in
December, 1567, while the hapless queen was
spending at Lochleven her first year of captivity,
in much better case. The country was divided
between "king's men" and "queen's men."
The Estates did what Murray and Morton
wished to be done. There is one provision
which, though in conformity with Murray's
views, does not bear the impress of his hand.
It reminds us that the author of the <i>First Blaste
against the Monstrous Regiment of Women</i> was
present as an assessor in the Parliament when
we read: "Als it is thocht expedient that in na
tymes cuming ony wemen sal be admittit to the
publict autoritie of the realme or functioun in
publict government within the same." It was
not a deliberate attempt to alter the succession:
it was merely an additional illustration of bad
feeling towards the captive queen.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
"Black Acts" there is little in the proceedings
of the Parliament which calls for remark. The
meetings were largely occupied with the usual
sentences of forfeiture. Sometimes the queen's
party held rival parliaments, and on such occasions
everybody in Scotland of any importance
was declared a traitor by one side or the other.
A considerable amount of valuable work was
done. Murray, whatever his personal character,
was a statesman, and he left the impression of
"a still strong man" upon those who survived
him. His policy and that of his successors was
guided by their dependence upon Elizabeth and
by their associations with the Assembly. Parliament
was largely occupied with the settlement
of the Church, but it found time to regulate
matters of police and trade. The influence of
the Assembly continued to be paramount till
1584, when, for the first time, King James was
able to assert his personality. The "Black
Acts" of that year included a declaration of the
king's royal power over all subjects, the supremity
of Parliament, the illegality of conventions
or assemblies not sanctioned by the king, and
the subjection of ministers of the Church to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
civil courts. No weight whatever can be given
to the phrase "supremity of Parliament." It
meant only that the king knew that he could
use the Parliament as he liked, while the Assembly
was as yet beyond his control. We do
not intend to enter into the complicated story
of the conflict between the king and the Church.
But from 1584 the Parliament was generally at
the disposal of the king. Still more is this the
case after the year 1603. The Parliament became
the mere shadow of the royal power. It
declared in 1606&mdash;the year after the defiance of
the king by the Aberdeen assembly&mdash;"our soverane
monarche, absolute prince, Judge, and
governor over all persones, Estaittis, and causis,
baith spirituall and temporall, within his said
realme." Only twelve years had elapsed since
Andrew Melville's speech. The union with England
meant that the king had power to coerce
Scotland. The same obsequious Parliament outraged
the national sentiment by the first establishment
of episcopacy, although the assembly
was still so strong that the bishops protested
that there was no design to alter the discipline
of the Kirk, "and submitted themselves in all
time comeing to the judgement of the General
Assemblie." Parliament was governed by the
Lords of the Articles, and they were the creatures
of the king. James did not exaggerate
when he said:<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> "Here I sit and governe it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
[Scotland] with my pen, I write and it is done,
and by a Clearke of the Councell I governe
Scotland now, which others could not do by the
sword." The satirist who accompanied King
James on his visit to Scotland in 1617 gave vent
to a merited sneer at the three Estates. "Their
parliaments," he wrote, "hold but three days;
their statutes are but three lines."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The anonymous
apologist who replied made no effort to
meet the accusation. It might have been King
James himself that wrote: "For the brevitie of
your parliaments ye are beholden to your wisdom,
for the brevitie of your statutes to your
justice."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The conduct of affairs in Scotland remained,
at first, unchanged by the death of James VI.
The few parliaments of the reign are occupied
with taxation, ratification, and other formal business.
James had been statesman enough to
fear the influence of Laud in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Charles
allowed a meddling ecclesiastic to stretch too
far the allegiance of his people to their ancient
House. The Parliament of 1628-30 is of no
importance in the history of Scotland. It was
poorly attended, and its deliberations were a
foregone conclusion. The Parliament of 1639
was crowded, and it began its work with a
protest against the method of electing the Lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the Articles. The protest was feeble enough
to be the first faint symptom of a revolution;
but the revolution had already taken place.
The people were led as before, not by the Parliament,
but by the Assembly. The Glasgow
Assembly of 1638, which continued to meet in
spite of its "dissolution" by the king's commissioner,
was the means by which a fatal blow
was given to the first <i>régime</i> of episcopacy and
absolute monarchy. It rendered possible the
revolutionary Parliament of 1640. We have
already noticed the more important of its proceedings.
It continued to look for support to
the Assembly. It grounded its resolution against
the presence of prelates in Parliament on the
Act of Assembly abolishing episcopacy. In 1641
it beseeched the assembly to sit in Edinburgh
instead of in St. Andrews, sending "some of
everie estait to represent" its sense of "the great
necessitie at this tyme of the concurring advyse
of both the Assemblie and Parliament," and
promising "to sett down ane solid course for
the beiring of the chairges of the Commissioners
to your yeirlie Generall Assemblies."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> From
1641 to 1650 Scotland was ruled by the Scottish
Parliament, in conjunction with the Assembly.
The Estates undertook the management of the
war, carried out the negotiations with the English
Parliament, and with the king, and were at the
same time able to give due attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
minutest local details. Like the Reformation
Parliament of 1560, the Covenant Parliament
of 1640 marks a distinct stage in Scottish constitutional
history. After we make all allowance
for the revolutionary nature of the time, and
for its dependence on the Assembly, it remains
true that it grew to occupy a position different
from that of any of its predecessors. It had
learned much from England. Not for the first
time, but more emphatically than ever before,
do we find the Estates adopting the language
of the English parliamentary opposition. On
the other hand, the Scottish Parliament was in
some ways in advance of its English sister.
When Charles I paid his second visit to Scotland,
in 1641, he found himself a puppet in the hands
of his erstwhile obedient Estates. As we have
seen, the Lords of the Articles became open
committees of Parliament, and they were jealously
watched by their colleagues. Parliament claimed
the appointment of the privy council, and all
the officers of state.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The reader will note with
surprise the large amount of space occupied by
the proceedings of Parliament during these years.
Much is merely the record of judicial acts, and
much was done by Parliament that we should
regard as pertaining to the executive. For our
present purpose it is unnecessary to descend to
particulars. Our main contention is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
supersession of the royal power was rendered
the more easy and the less significant because
of the official character of the normal parliamentary
procedure. The Estates, having the
power to defy the king, could point to their own
history as good warrant for their use of it. The
sovereign had never dared to prorogue them
against their will, they argued. Charles knew
that they spoke the truth, and he could but
accept the position. If the record of the Estates
was one long submission, it did not contain a
defeat, and it was capable of two interpretations.
So, after the death of the king, the men who
had just executed Huntly sent to offer terms
to Charles II. It is significant that there were
four representatives of the Estates, and three of
the Assembly. The power was still conjoint, although
Parliament during these years of struggle
had learned to act. When the young king came
to Scotland he found himself little more than
a prisoner in the hands of the grim, staunch
fearless men who surrounded him. He was
forced to sign the most humiliating confessions
of the sins of his family, and he abjured "Prelacy
and all errors, schism, and profaneness." Cromwell's
victory changed the aspect of affairs,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and
ended, for the time, the history of the Parliament
of Scotland. The short-lived "union" did not
take effect till 1654, but from the date of the
battle of Dunbar both Assembly and Estates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
had to acknowledge their master. In 1653 the
General Assembly was reduced to plead "that we
were ane Ecclesticall synod, ane spirituall court
of Jesus Christ, which medled not with anything
civile."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> But the Assembly ceased to meet: and
the Government of Scotland was neither ecclesiastical
nor civil, but martial. The Parliament
agreed to the union: once again because it was
ordered so to do.</p>

<p>The story of the Cromwellian parliaments is no
part of our subject. Scottish counties and burghs
were represented, and an elaborate scheme was
prepared to adjust the proper proportions&mdash;a
scheme which afterwards was the model for
further developments.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Two acts were passed
by the united Parliament which affected the
current of Scottish history&mdash;the establishment of
free trade with England and the abolition of
feudality.</p>

<p class="b1">The Commonwealth passed away, and Scotland
had once more its Covenanted King. The irony
of fate used the Committee of Estates, the body
which Charles I had known as an enemy, to
deliver the country to an absolute monarchy.
The Committee of Estates was followed, when
the king's commissioner arrived, by the meeting
of the Restoration Parliament. The main difficulty
was the religious one. Parliament was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
reduced to the position it had occupied before
1638. In 1661 it passed an act which rescinded
all its own statutes since 1640. It humbly confessed
the king's right to choose all officers of
state, and members of the privy council; it acknowledged
his right to call and prorogue Parliament;
it re-established the tyranny of the Lords
of the Articles. It recalled bishops to Parliament,
and proscribed the national religion. Even when
the English Parliament had recovered from its
emotional loyalty, and begun to resume its old
attitude to the king, the Scottish Estates remained
absolutely at his disposal. When, later still, the
succession was disputed in England, an act was
passed in Scotland to declare that it could not be
altered "without involving the subjects in perjury
and rebellion." When Charles II died, Parliament
addressed James VII in terms ludicrously
obsequious. "The death of that our excellent
monarch is lamented by us to all the degrees of
grief that are consistent with our great joy for the
succession of your sacred majesty." Between 1660
and 1689 the Scottish Parliament was once more
the merest instrument for official sanction. A contemporary
has left us his impressions of the time.
He tells us that the methods of the Lords of the
Articles were not quite so secret as they used to be.</p>

<p class="pnbq">Of late times matters have been at full length and freely
debated in Parliament. They sit all in one House, and every
one answers distinctly to his name and gives his vote, which
is in these terms, <i>I approve</i> or <i>not</i>; only those who are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
satisfied one way or another, say <i>Non liquet</i>, which is a great
ease to those who are conscientious, and a common refuge to
the cunning Politicians; the major vote carries it. No dissents
or protests are allowed in public acts, but are accounted
treasonable.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p class="pn p1 b1">The arm of the Government was all-powerful, and
they had not even to guard against opposition.
A caricature of the General Assembly was maintained
to give a further ecclesiastical ratification
to the king's acts, "But," adds our informant,</p>

<p class="pnbq">as the calling of this synod is wholly in the Crown, so there is
little need of it, since the King's Supremacy is so large, that
He needs not there concurrence, to adde their Authority to
anything that He shall think fit to doe about Church affairs.</p>

<p class="p1">It may be at first matter of surprise that Scotland
should so completely have succumbed. All
that the popular party could do was to suffer.
Only on rare occasions could they take the field.
Suffering or fighting, they never yielded. But
the dearth of constitutional life is not inexplicable.
Had the Restoration occurred ten years earlier,
it would have been otherwise. The Commonwealth
had blotted out the recollection of the
years which preceded it, and prepared the way
for the years that followed it. Bishop Burnet's
remark, that the root of the trouble lay in the
king's "entering in without condition," was true,
at all events, for the historian's own country.
Moreover, we must not forget the condition of
the country. The long-continued struggle had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
brought desolation where before the union of the
crowns we can trace prosperity. In Glasgow, in
1692, "near fyve hundredth houses [were] standing
waste." The harbour of Ayr was ruinous. The
High Street of Dumfries contained scarcely a
habitable house.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Trade and commerce had declined.
The short interval of freedom of trade
had but served to intensify the pressure of the
Navigation Act. Scotsmen boasted of their
"conquest" of England in 1603. England had
but given their kings the power to oppress them.</p>

<p>A free Parliament met again in 1689. The
absence of any strict constitutional feeling led,
as so often before, to the assumption of a much
more advanced position than that of the English
Parliament. Nothing is more characteristic of
the slowly broadening growth of English parliamentary
claims than the delicate adjustment
of conflicting theories by the Convention. In
Scotland no such nice adjustment was possible.
The proceedings are marked rather by a rude
logic. The Estates enumerated the misdeeds
of the unfortunate monarch in language distinguished
from that of the Claim of Rights only
by its strength.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The details are not important
for our purpose. There is no appeal to precedent,
nor any nicety of phrasing. James, having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
guilty of this catalogue of crimes, had "forfaulted
the right to the Crown, and the throne is become
vacant." The underlying theory is sufficiently
clear, but it was based on the logic of events.
It was probably an effect of the English connections
that the Estates went further than usual,
and laid down two general principles. All the
acts that they had enumerated were illegal. No
papist might be king or queen of Scotland.
With these conditions, and one other limitation,
they proceeded to offer the crown to William
and Mary and to entail it, in default of their
heirs, upon the Princess Anne. That other clause
expressed a claim which, for the people of Scotland,
included civil liberties, and had been throughout
the troubles synonymous with freedom. The
Estates declared that "Prelacy is a great and insupportable
grievance to the nation." A "Covenanted
King" it was impossible to hope for, nor
is there evidence that they desired to repeat the
experiment. But the new sovereigns must understand
the situation. When the acceptance of
William and Mary converted, without any further
change, the Convention into a Parliament, the
Estates set themselves to solving the religious
problem. They rescinded the act of Charles II
asserting "his majestie's supremacy over all persons
and in all causes ecclesiastical" as "inconsistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with the establishment of Church government
now desired." They restored the presbyterian
clergy to their churches and manses. They
approved the Westminster Confession of Faith&mdash;the
sole product of those efforts towards a covenanted
uniformity which had led the Church into
somewhat devious paths&mdash;and they established
Church government "by Kirk Sessions, Presbyteries,
Provincial Synods, and General Assemblies."
The more rigid presbyterians were disappointed.
It was not so emphatic a settlement
as they desired. Independent as the Establishment
was, it seemed Erastian to men whose only
associations with the functions of government had
been connected with Grierson of Lagg and Bloody
Mackenzie. King William insisted upon the extension
of a toleration to Episcopalian Dissenters
in Scotland which, as the Church more than once
complained, was lacking in the treatment of Presbyterian
Dissenters in England. The Revolution
Settlement, therefore, was not accepted by the
whole of the popular party, and the Jacobites
were reinforced by ousted episcopalians on the
one hand, and presbyterian malcontents on the
other. But the compromise of 1690 satisfied the
majority of the nation. The credit of the arrangement
belongs neither to the Parliament nor to the
king, but to the wise statesman who presided over
the University of Edinburgh. The English Revolution
of 1689 was in its origin religious, but it
early assumed the aspect of a purely civil movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
The Revolution in Scotland suggests to-day
only the Church Settlement, and the course
it took was decided by William Carstares.</p>

<p>The Parliament of 1690 proceeded to assert its
own freedom of action. Henceforward till the
Treaty of Union took effect, we have parliamentary
independence in Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> as far as
purely internal affairs were concerned. After
William's death we find still wider claims. The
events of William's reign had not been such as
to draw the nations nearer each other, or to
reconcile the Parliament to the limitation of its
sphere of influence to internal administration.
King William had been responsible for the
Massacre of Glencoe; he had forced Scotland
to expend large sums upon a war in which, after
the battle of Killiecrankie, she took no interest.
The Parliament of England had urged the king
to an interference with the Darien Scheme, which
could not be regarded in Scotland as other than
a betrayal. The Scottish Estates had not responded
to the Act of Settlement in 1700, and
when Queen Anne succeeded, the attitude of
the two countries was becoming increasingly
threatening. England regarded any advance of
Scottish prosperity as a success gained at her
own cost. Scotland feared that the country was
to be permanently under foreign influence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
rapid growth of a constitutional feeling since
1690 aided the circumstances of the time in the
production of parliamentary parties, a unique
event in Scottish history. The meeting of
Estates in 1703 contained Williamites, Patriots,
and Cavaliers.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The first of these supported
the government of King William and his successor
as, at all events, the least of the many
possible evils. The Cavaliers clamoured for the
return of the exiled House. The Patriot or
"Country" party, headed by Hamilton, Tweeddale,
and Fletcher of Saltoun, argued that, if
foreign domination were to continue, it made
but little difference whether it emanated from
St. Germains or from the Court of St. James's.
A combination of Cavaliers and Patriots passed
the Act of Security. This famous act named
no successor to Queen Anne. It invested the
Parliament with the power of the Crown, in case
of the queen's dying without heirs, and entrusted
to it the choice of a Protestant sovereign "from
the Royal line." It refused to such king or
queen, if also sovereign of England, the power
of peace and war, without consent of Parliament.
It enacted, further, that the union of the crowns
should determine, unless Scotland was admitted
to equal trade and navigation privileges with
England. Nor was there lacking the intention
to make good the threat. The same act provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
for the compulsory training of every Scotsman
to bear arms. The Scottish Parliament
debated each clause with vigour. The Estates
recognized that now, if scarcely ever before,
momentous issues hung upon their decision,
and the walls of the Parliament House re-echoed
with the unwonted excitement of party cries.
The royal commissioner declined to give the
queen's assent. The Parliament refused to grant
supplies, and the meeting broke up amid confused
shouts of "Liberty before Subsidy." The
bitterness of the struggle was accentuated by
a silly dispute about the Jacobite Plot, and the
temper of the two nations was strained to the
utmost.</p>

<p>The union of the crowns had been rendered
possible only by the self-restraint which permitted
the people of England to accept a Scotsman as
the king. A similar spirit of self-restraint now
actuated Queen Anne's advisers. The queen
assented to the Act of Security, and the Scots
began to train for a war that was not to be
fought by the sword. The English ministers
proposed a union of the kingdoms. Fortunately,
they recognized that Scotland was in
earnest, and expressed their willingness to yield
somewhat on the main point&mdash;freedom of trade.
Into the long and dreary negotiations which
preceded the union we need not enter. Amid
jealousy, faction, and evils still more sordid, the
treaty of union was concluded. The agreement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
secured to Scotland the maintenance of her law,
and the continued existence of her universities,
and it guaranteed that there would be no interference
with the Church as by law established.
On the other hand, the kingdom surrendered
her national existence, and was forced to be
content with a miserably inadequate representation
in the English Parliament. It is little
wonder that the people in general, and especially
the populace of Edinburgh, regarded the
treaty with horror and looked upon its supporters
as traitors. Amid riot and uproar, and
with howls of execration sounding in their ears,
the Estates of Scotland met for the last time
on 25th March, 1707, under the presidency of
the lord chancellor, the Earl of Seafield. Among
some of the senators themselves there was an
uneasy feeling that they had sold their country
for trade privileges which the givers would strain
every nerve to render worthless. Others were
more callous. "There's the end o' an auld
sang," laughed the Chancellor, as the Honours
of Scotland were carried out of the Parliament
House for the last time.</p>

<p>There is a touch of pathos in this final scene.
To us, it can appear sad only with the sadness
of changefulness. But the faces of contemporaries
were turned backwards. The three
Estates had survived many revolutions. It was
true that their history did not represent the best
of the nation's life; but with that best it had ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
been more or less closely associated. In recent
years the Parliament had come to mean national
existence. It had entered into a new sphere,
and assumed new functions. A career of usefulness
seemed to lie before it. In spite of its
age, its end was, in this sense, premature. The
conditions, too, were ignominious. The accumulated
hatred of four hundred years had attached
itself to the names of Darien and Glencoe. England
had yielded much less than a free and independent
nation had a right to ask, and Scotland
could not demand more, because the men whom
she trusted had failed her.</p>

<p>No doubt the Chancellor was right. It was
"the end o' an auld sang." But, after all, the
Estates had received "the wages of going on,
and still to be." It did not appear so at the
first. The Parliament of Great Britain broke
more than one pledge solemnly made at the union.
The highest boon that King James or Prince
Charles could promise to Scotland was the repeal
of the union. The Scottish representatives had
little weight in the councils of the Empire. Even
the faithful Argyll was thwarted, and his service
lightly esteemed. The best blood of the country
was spilt on foreign battlefields and in alien
quarrels. The genius of a Keith served only
to lead to victory the troops of Frederick the
Great, and to guide the steps of Russia towards
Constantinople. Among the exiles, there were
others, less fortunate, who found no scope for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
their talents, and no friends in the land of the
stranger. But, as time passed, the tragic element
faded out of the story, and, with the rapid growth
of prosperity, the influence of Scotland on the
destinies of the nation became more apparent.
The land of Kennedy and Elphinstone, of Lethington
and Carstares, could not fail to produce
wise and prudent statesmen, who might find,
on a wider stage, the renown that had been
denied to those who went before them. The
music of the "auld sang" resounded again, although
the walls that re-echoed it were those of
Westminster. The Imperial Parliament meets
close to the ancient Abbey, the guardian of the
Stone of Fate, which the first Edward carried in
triumph from Scotland, and on which, for nigh
three hundred years, descendant after descendant
of his enemy has sat. As the old prophecy has
not been rendered void by the transference of its
subject from Scone to London, so the promise
that gave meaning to the last years of the Scottish
Parliament has not failed of fulfilment. <i>Nec
tamen consumebatur.</i></p>

<h2 class="p4">APPENDIX</h2>

<p class="pn center lmid">REPRESENTATION IN THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p class="pn p2 b1">Although we know that burgesses were present at the
Cambuskenneth Parliament, we possess no information as to
what towns they represented. The first list of burghs in
the Acts of Parliament refers to the Council held in 1357
to arrange about the ransom of King David II, and it includes
the following towns:&mdash;Aberdeen, Crail, Cupar, Dumbarton,
Dumfries, Dundee, Edinburgh, Haddington, Inverkeithing,
Lanark, Linlithgow, Montrose, Perth, Peebles, Rutherglen,
Stirling, and St. Andrews. From 1367, we have, occasionally,
records of the election of burgesses to the Committee of
the Articles, and these give us our only information regarding
representation. (Cf. pp. 26-33.) We subjoin the first
known date of the representation of any burgh at a regular
meeting of the Estates in Parliament assembled. It must,
of course, be understood that this list does not, in any way,
pretend to completeness; the material is incomplete, and, in
most cases when burghs are mentioned, up to the sixteenth
century, it is only in connection with the Lords of the Articles.</p>

<p class="pnl b1"><span class="smcap">Fourteenth Century</span>:&mdash;Aberdeen, Dundee, Montrose, Linlithgow,
Perth, Edinburgh, Haddington (1367).</p>

<p class="pnl b1"><span class="smcap">Fifteenth Century</span>:&mdash;Inverness (1439); Stirling (1449);
St. Andrews, Cupar (1456); Lanark (1467); Peebles
(1468); Elgin, Banff, Ayr, Irvine, Dumfries, Wigtown,
Kirkcudbright, Selkirk, Jedburgh, Dunbar (1469); Forfar,
Crail, Kinghorn, Inverkeithing, Dumbarton (1471);
Brechin, Rutherglen, Renfrew, North Berwick (1478);
Rothesay (1484); Forres (1488).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p class="pnl b1"><span class="smcap">Sixteenth Century</span>:&mdash;Glasgow (1560); Tain, Nairn, Lauder
(1567); Kintore, Pittenweem (1579); Kirkcaldy (1585);
Burntisland (1586); Dingwall (1587); Cullen, Culross,
E. and W. Anstruther (1593); Dysart (1594).</p>

<p class="pnl b1"><span class="smcap">Seventeenth Century</span>:&mdash;Inverurie, Bervie, Kilrenny, Lochmaben,
Annan (1612); Sanquhar (1621); Dunfermline,
New Galloway (1628); Dornoch, Arbroath, Queensferry,
Whithorn (1639); Fortrose, Inverary (1660); Kirkwall
(1667); Stranraer (1685); Campbeltown (1689); Wick
(1690).</p>

<p>In addition to these, Berwick-on-Tweed was represented
between 1469 and 1481, Cromarty from 1660-72, and Findhorn
in 1648.</p>

<p>Representation of the shires does not begin till 1593; but
between that date and 1617, we find nearly all the counties
represented. Argyleshire, however, does not appear till 1628,
Sutherland not till 1633, and Kinross not till 1681.</p>

<p>It gradually became usual for each burgh to send two
members; but, in 1619, the Convention of Royal Burghs
reduced the number to one, except in the case of Edinburgh.
Under the Protectorate, Scotland was represented
by twenty members for the shires and ten for the burghs,
which, with the exception of Edinburgh, were divided into
nine groups, each returning one member. Edinburgh, alone,
returned two representatives. At the union of the Parliaments
in 1707, Scotland received forty-five members. The burghs,
except Edinburgh, were divided into fourteen groups, returning
one member each, and one member was allotted to
Edinburgh. It is to be remembered that only Royal Burghs
had any representation in Scotland up to 1832, except in so
far as burghs of barony were represented by the county
members, along with the other freeholders of the country.
When the town of Cromarty ceased to be a Royal Burgh,
in 1672, it was excised from the parliamentary records. Of
the remaining thirty members, each shire, except six, returned
a member each. These six were divided into three groups,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Bute and Caithness, Clackmannan and Kinross, and Nairn
and Cromarty. The two shires which each group contained
were given the right to return a member to alternate parliaments,
<i>e.g.</i> Bute, Clackmannan, and Nairn in 1708, and
Caithness, Kinross, and Cromarty in 1710.</p>

<p>From these facts, various interesting conclusions can be
drawn. The meagre nature of the evidence prevents our
making any inferences of a constitutional nature; but the
rise of the small burghs on the East coast in the end of the
fifteenth century, throws considerable light upon the economic
history of Scotland. It is also suggestive that the burgh of
Inverary was not represented till 1660, and Argyleshire not
till 1628. But such matters as these belong rather to the
domain of political history, and do not fall within our province.</p>

<p class="pn">Of the English Language. A complete Encyclopedic Lexicon,
Literary, Etymological, Scientific, Technological, and Pronouncing.</p>

<p class="pn center">
By <span class="smcap">John Ogilvie, LL.D.</span><br />
<i>NEW EDITION. CAREFULLY REVISED AND GREATLY AUGMENTED</i><br />
By CHARLES ANNANDALE, M.A., LL.D.</p>

<p class="reduct p1">"The <span class="smcap">Imperial Dictionary</span> is a work which fairly deserves the epithet of monumental. It is
really what it professes to be&mdash;'a complete encyclopædic lexicon, literary, scientific, and technological'.
In other words it is the best dictionary of its kind in the English language, and its kind
is the best."&mdash;<b>St. James's Gazette.</b></p>

<p class="reduct">The four volumes of the New Edition comprise a total of over 3000 pages.
Of modern terms relating to science, technology, and the arts, a full collection
will be found. Many colloquialisms, provincialisms, Americanisms, and a list of
foreign words used by English writers are given. The discrimination of synonyms
has been carefully attended to, while the etymology and pronunciation have been
modelled on the latest authorities.</p>

<p class="reduct">As an Encyclopedic Dictionary the <span class="smcap">Imperial</span> combines the advantages of an
ordinary dictionary with those of an encyclopedia. And as there are many objects
and terms of which no adequate description or definition can be given by mere
words, this dictionary does not rely upon verbal description alone, the definitions
being supplemented by upwards of 3000 accurate and beautiful wood engravings.</p>

<p class="pn center reduct p1"><i>In 4 vols, imperial 8vo. Cloth, £4 nett; or half-morocco, £5 nett</i></p>

<p class="reduct p1"><b>The Times</b> <i>says</i>:&mdash;"So far as vocabulary and treatment are concerned, we should not wish for
anything better than the new <i>Imperial</i>. The definitions are accurate and intelligible, developing
into detailed explanations where necessary. The etymology is clear and concise, and the illustrations
are copious, appropriate, and well executed."</p>

<p class="reduct"><b>The Spectator</b> <i>says</i>:&mdash;"a laborious enterprise, for which we have only words of cordial
praise.... It is the best English Lexicon of the time."</p>

(<i>Spanish Calendar</i>, i. 210), divides the revenue of James IV into six main
heads&mdash;(1) Leases of Crown lands, held for three years and redeemable
by a fine. (2) Customs. "The import duties are insignificant, but the
exports yield a considerable sum of money, because there are three principal
articles of export, that is to say, wood, hides, and fish." (3) The
profits of justice. James's predecessors "farmed it to certain persons
called justices.... This king does not like to farm the administration
of the law, because justice is not well administered in that way." (4) The
ordinary feudal incidents&mdash;reliefs, wardships, and marriage. (5) Vacant
bishoprics, abbacies, &amp;c. (6) Rent in kind, from meat and poultry, and
especially from fisheries. Only one of these, namely, customs duties,
could have been regulated by the Estates, and there is on record no
instance of any attempt to do so. The revenue was collected on the
English system, described in the <i>Dialogus de Scaccario</i>. The sheriffs
and the king's stewards collected the sums due in the counties, and the
bailiffs and "custumars" had charge of the amercement of the burghs
and the collection of the customs. The main differences between the
system in Scotland under James IV and that of England under Henry VII
is that the Scottish Exchequer Court was not so fully organized as the
English, and that the system of checks on the honesty of the sheriffs, &amp;c.,
was much less elaborate. All the sources of revenue were, as a rule,
"farmed out"; the king received a composition, and the actual collector
made as much profit as he could.</p></div>

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The evidence upon which the theory of popular representation is
based is as vague as the theory itself. Eadmer (<i>Hist. Nov.</i> p. 97, Lond.
1623; cf. also p. 134) tells us of an election, in 1107, of a bishop of St.
Andrews "by Alexander, king of Scotland, the clergy, and the people."
The Book of Scone (<i>Liber de Scon.</i> p. 1) describes the re-foundation of the
abbey in 1114-15 by King Alexander. It is confirmed by his wife and
nephew, several bishops, and a number of nobles, "consilio proborum
hominum." Ten years later, at the foundation of the abbey of Dunfermline
(<i>Registrum de Dunfermelyn</i>, p. 3; cf. also the Charters of
Holyrood), we find a phrase employed to which some importance has
been attached. Bishops and nobles confirm as usual, but with the
acquiescence of the people and clergy. The form "clero etiam acquiescente
et populo" is of frequent occurrence. The phrase "all the community
of the kingryk" has been treated in the text. The similar phrases
"probi homines" and "clero acquiescente et populo" are simply common
technical terms belonging to the Chancery imitated by the Scottish scribe.
The latter does not even imply consultation, and the former means the
smaller tenants-in-chief. In the <i>Laws of the Burghs</i> we find it used for
the leading men&mdash;the <i>optimates</i>&mdash;of the town. It is not a popular term
at all. On the other hand, too, we have councils described in quite
different terms. In 1174 William the Lion held a council at Stirling, and
asked an aid from his "optimates" (Fordun, viii. 73). In 1190 the
"prelati et proceres" of Scotland gave the king 10,000 marks (Fordun,
viii. 62). On the death of Alexander III the guardians describe themselves
as "de communi consilio constituti" (<i>Hist. Doc. relating to Scotland</i>,
i. 95), while Rishanger tells how "omnes Scoti" chose Wallace.
The change in the political circumstances is sufficient to account for
whatever importance may be attached to the words. It is true that
Fordun, speaking of the same period, frequently uses the word Estates
("communitates"). But Fordun was not a contemporary, and the word
had acquired a technical meaning by his time. Moreover, he uses the
word very loosely. Sometimes he intends by it the land itself, as when
he tells us how the English ravaged it.</p></div>

a place in Parliament, the theory was not at once extended to the meetings
known as conventions, which could impose taxes, and possessed
every parliamentary power except that of passing general laws. In 1503
an act was passed, ordering that "commissioners and head men of
burghs be warned" to attend conventions; but it had to be re-enacted in
1563, and even after that date it was not completely operative. Between
1566 (the first date of their recorded presence) and the end of the sixteenth
century burgesses were present at only half of the conventions
which were held. It is important to note that the royal burghs alone
had parliamentary representation up to the year 1832.</p></div>

has been stated and rejected by English constitutional historians is
scarcely applicable. For it is agreed that the idea of representation
existed in England before the towns were summoned to Parliament,
while in Scotland no such idea is traceable, nor are there any writs such
as were issued for the English towns. It might even be argued that, in
strict theory, there was no representation in Scotland till 1832; that
commissioners both from shires and burghs only saved their fellows the
trouble of attendance, the right to attend being, not <i>de facto</i> but in
ultimate theory, possessed by all who were entitled to vote. Such a
statement is certainly true of the shire, at all events.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="pfn"><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> The right of prorogation is tacitly assumed by the king in this
speech. It was the cause of a dispute in the troublous times which
followed 1638. The Parliament of 1640 protested that "Johne, Erle
of Traquair, his Majestie's Commissioner, did take upon him without
consent of the Estates, upon a private warrand, procured by himself,
against his Majestie's publict patent, under the great seall," to prorogue
Parliament. They therefore continued to sit, and took up stronger
ground, viz. that prorogation without consent of Parliament was
"against the lawes and libertie of the kingdom, ... without precedent,
example, and practice." The language is clearly taken from the contemporary
protests of the English Commons, and it cannot be regarded
as more than a political weapon, borrowed for this occasion from the
English constitutional armoury. It in no way corresponds with the
general state of feeling in Scotland. In 1661 the Estates resolved that
"the King hath sole power to call and prorogue Parliaments." Both
resolutions were recognitions of fact, not of theory. At various times,
from 1398 onwards, acts were passed that Parliament should meet once
a year. These were probably connected with the judicial powers of the
Estates. In point of fact, they were dead letters.</p></div>

was informed that the grants were to be used for special purposes. No
general statement was made which could be construed into a definite
claim of the right of appropriation of supplies. The "Parliament"
merely used for a particular purpose the power which at that moment
it chanced to possess. It is the absence of any assertion of or struggle
for constitutional principle that is ultimately decisive against the "constitutional"
theory. When, as here, the nobles had the power, they said
they would do certain things, and they did them. But there is no conscious
effort, traceable from generation to generation, such as we find in

the refusal of the Lords of the Articles to allow the king to aid Louis XI
of France in 1473. But the action of the Estates was simply the action
of the chancellor, Evandale, and his party, who ruled the king with a rod
of iron. It is very likely that there was, especially among the clergy, a
strong general feeling against going to war, and this feeling strengthened
the king's jailers. But the opposition of a small ruling clique of nobles
to the whim of a powerless monarch is scarcely to be regarded as a great
constitutional fact. It must also be remembered that the few who constituted
the Lords of the Articles were virtually the Estates.</p></div>

against Mary. If we knew all that lay behind this motion, we should
probably possess a key to the problems on which so much ingenuity has
been exercised. The statement, frequently quoted, that the Estates
passed a solemn resolution affirming their power to depose the sovereign
rests solely on the authority of Buchanan, and is directly antagonistic to
the language both of the <i>Acts</i> and of the Scottish commissioners' protestations
at York and Westminster, in which Mary is represented as abdicating
of her own free will.</p></div>
